<section title='Introduction'>
<t>This is a package to convert memos written in XML to the RFC format.</t>

<t>If you don't want to install any software,
you can use the
<eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>web-based service</eref>.</t>
</section>

<section title='Requirements'>
<t>You need to have Tcl/Tk version 8 running on your system.
Tcl is a scripting language,
Tk is Tcl with support for your windowing system.</t>
    
<t>To get a source or binary distribution for your system,
go to the
<eref target='http://www.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/8.4.html'>Scriptics website</eref>
and install it.
If you get the binary distribution,
this is pretty simple.</t>
    
<figure>
<preamble>Of course,
you may already have Tcl version 8.
To find out,
try typing this command from the shell
(or the "MS-DOS Prompt"):</preamble>
<artwork>
    % tclsh
</artwork>
<postamble>If the program launches,
you're good to go with Tcl version 8.</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>If you are running under a windowing system (e.g., X or Windows),
you can also try:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % wish
</artwork>
<postamble>If a new window comes up along with a "Console" window,
then you're good to go with Tk version 8.</postamble>
</figure>

<t>Finally,
you may notice a file called |"xml2sgml.tcl| in the distribution.
It contains some extra functionality for a few special users &#151;
so, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it...</t>
</section>

<section title='Testing'>
<t>Now test your installation.</t>
    
<section title='Testing under a windowing system'>
<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % xml2rfc.tcl
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>A new window should come up that looks like this:</preamble>

<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % tclsh
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>If the program launches, type this command to it:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % source xml2rfc.tcl
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>and you should see these four lines:</preamble>
<artwork>
    invoke as "xml2rfc   inputfile outputfile"
           or "xml2txt   inputfile"
           or "xml2html  inputfile"
           or "xml2nroff inputfile"
</artwork>

<section title='Next steps'>
<t>Read the <eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html'>2629bis</eref>
document.
In particular,
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#anchor13'>Section 3</eref>
has some good information.</t>

<section anchor='processing.instructions' title='Processing Instructions'>
<figure>
<preamble>A |*processing instruction| is a directive to an XML
application.
If you want to give directives to |'xml2rfc|,
the processing instructions (PIs) look like this:</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc keyword='value'?>
</artwork>
<postamble>Of course,
if you like the default behavior,
you don't need any PIs in your input file!</postamble>
</figure>

<section title='Option Settings'>
<figure>
<preamble>The list of valid keywords are:</preamble>
<artwork>
    keyword     default     meaning
    =======     =======     =======
    strict      no          try to enforce the ID-nits conventions

    iprnotified no          included 2026 10.4(d) boilerplate

    compact     no          when producing a txt/nroff file, try
                            to conserve vertical whitespace
    
    subcompact  compact     if compact is "yes", then setting
                            this to "no" will make things a 
                            little less compact

    toc         no          generate a table-of-contents

    tocompact   yes         if toc is "yes", then setting this to
                            "no" will make it a little less compact

    tocdepth    3           if toc is "yes", then this determines the
                            depth of the table-of-contents

    editing     no          insert editing marks for ease of
                            discussing draft versions

    private     ""          produce a private memo rather than
                            an RFC or Internet-Draft.

    header      ""          override the leftmost header string

    footer      ""          override the center footer string

    slides      no          when producing an html file, produce
                            multiple files for a slide show

    sortrefs    no          sort references

    symrefs     no          use anchors rather than numbers for
                            references

    topblock    yes         put the famous header block on the first
                            page

    background  ""          when producing an html file, use this
                            image

    needLines   n/a         an integer hint indicating how many
                            contiguous lines are needed at this
			    point in the output
</artwork>
<postamble>Remember,
that as with everything else in XML,
keywords and values are case-sensitive.</postamble>
</figure>

<t>With the exception of the |'needLines| PI,
you normally put all of these processing instructions at the beginning
of the document
(right after the XML declartion).</t>
</section>

<section title='Include Files'>
<figure>
<preamble>|'xml2rfc| has an include-file facility,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc include='file'?>
</artwork>
<postamble>|'xml2rfc| will consult the $XML_LIBRARY environment variable
for a search path of where to look for files.
(If this envariable isn't set,
the directory containing the file that contains the include-file
directive is used.)</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>You can also have |'xml2rfc| set this envariable directly,
by creating a file called |".xml2rfc.rc| in the directory where your
main file is,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork><![CDATA[
global env tcl_platform

if {![string compare $tcl_platform(platform) windows]} {
    set sep ";"
} else {
    set sep ":"
}

if {[catch { set env(XML_LIBRARY) } library]} {
    set library ""
    foreach bibxmlD [lsort -dictionary \
                           [glob -nocomplain $HOME/rfcs/bibxml/*]] {
        append library $sep$bibxmlD
    }
}

set nativeD [file nativename $inputD]
if {[lsearch [split $library $sep] $nativeD] < 0} {
    set library "$nativeD$sep$library"
}

set env(XML_LIBRARY) $library
]]></artwork>
</figure>

<t>There are links to various bibliographic databases (RFCs, I-Ds, and so on)
on the |'xml2rfc| <eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>homepage</eref>.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section title='Additions to RFC 2629'>
<t>A few additions have been made to the format originally defined in
RFC 2629.
In particular,
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#anchor19'>Appendix C</eref>
of the 2629bis document enumerates the additions.</t>

<t>In addition,
|'xml2rfc| recognizes an undocumented |'src| attribute in the
|'artwork| element,
but only if HTML is being generated,
e.g.,
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
       <figure><artwork src='layers.gif' /></figure>
]]></artwork>
<postamble>In this case,
an |'img| tag is placed in the HTML output,
and the textual contents of the |'artwork|, |'preamble|, and
|'postamble| elements are ignored.</postamble>
</figure></t>
</section>

<section title='Limitations of xml2rfc'>
<t><list style='symbols'>
<t>The |'figure| element's |'title| attribute is ignored,
except when generating HTML.</t>

<t>The |'xref| element's |'pageno| attribute is ignored.</t>
</list></t>

<section title="MacOS 9 Installation (courtesy of Ned Freed)">
<t><list style='numbers'>
<t>Install Tcl/Tk 8.3.4</t>

<t>When you performed Step 1,
a folder in your |""Extensions"| folder called |""Tool Command Language"| was 
created.
Create a new folder under |""Extensions"|,
with any name you like.</t>

<t>Drag the file |"xml2rfc.tcl| onto the |""Drag &amp; Drop Tclets"|
application that was installed in Step 1.</t>

<t>When asked for an appropriate |"wish| stub,
select |""Wish 8.3.4"|.</t>

<t>The |""Drap &amp; Drop Tclets"| application will write out an
executable version of |'xml2rfc|.</t>
</list></t>
</section>

<section title='rfc2629.xslt (courtesy of Julian Reschke)'>
<t>The file |"rfc2629.xslt| can be used with an XSLT-capable formatter
(i.e., IE6) to produce HTML.
A word of warning though:
the XSLT script doesn't support the processing instructions discussed
<xref target='processing.instructions'>earlier</xref>.</t>
