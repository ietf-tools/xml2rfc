==============         TclXML Changes File         ==============

14/12/1998 steve	CDATA

	Fixed simple CDATA section processing

	Started building test suite (at last!)

15/12/1998 steve	Started changes file

	Fixed bug which allowed trailing ? in PIs to
	be passed through to the application.  Also
	checks that trailing ? is included

	Changed xml.tcl attribute list parsing proc
	to use same "Name" definition as per spec for
	attribute names.

16/12/1998 steve	More CDATA fixes

22/12/1998 steve	New -commentcommand option

	Added -commentcommand option.  This is called with
	comment data.  Added comment.test and made bug fixes
	to comment code.

	CDATA, PI bug fixes.

18/1/1999 steve		Added xmldeclcommand and doctypecommand

	XML Declaration and Document Type Definition are reported
	to the application via the -xmldeclcommand and -doctypecommand
	callbacks respectively.

27/1/1999 steve		Added (approximate) line numbers to errors

	Count lines during parsing.  Line numbers are reported by
	error commands.

31/1/1999 steve		Incompatibility: -empty option for element callbacks

	When empty elements are encountered (eg <Example/>) the callback
	command has an additional option, -empty 1, appended.
	Both the -elementstartcommand and -elementendcommand are affected.

24/2/1999 steve		Changed attribute list parsing

	Attribute list parsing didn't cope with values containing '='
	character.  New parser code iterates through the list, which may
	be slower but more accurate.

	steve		DTD parsing patches

	Incorporated various patches to the DTD parsing code from 
	Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	steve		Bug fix

	Fixed bug in parsing PIs.  Tag and PI data were not protected
	during an uplevel call.

10/3/1999 Larry Kollar,
	steve		Replaced entity reference processing

	Larry submitted a fix for the xml::Entity, et al, procedure
	but the whole entity reference handling issued had to be sorted
	out properly.  Two options were added, -entityreferencecommand and
	-entityvariable.  Parser now handles character entities, pre-defined
	and defined general entities automatically using the latter option.
	Unknown general entities are passed to the callback given by the
	former option.  If no callback is given then the entity references 
	are left as-is.

==============   Released Version 1.1 10/03/1998   ==============

20/3/1999 steve		Fixed misfiring internal DTD substitution, CDATA section
					and misc. bug fixes

	The tokenisation stage was extracting a CDATA section which it thought
	was an internal DTD subset.  Tightened the RE to fix this.

	CDATA sections should not be passed through entity replacement.

	Fixed bugs in test scripts.

	Fixed passing -reportempty option from xml module to sgml module.

	Changed handling of PCDATA and entities.  TclXML 1.1 introduced an
	incompatibility (reported by Marshall Rose).  PCDATA callbacks now occur
	separately for entities.  The fix checks to see if an entity mappings
	are defined or an entityreference callback.  If neither have been defined
	then the old behaviour is restored.

==============   Released Version 1.1.1 21/03/1998   ==============
