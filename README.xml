<section title='Introduction'>
<t>This is a package to convert memos written in XML to the RFC format.</t>

<t>If you don't want to install any software,
you can use the
<eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>web-based service</eref>.</t>
</section>

<section title='Requirements'>
<t>You need to have Tcl/Tk version&nbsp;8 running on your system.
Tcl is a scripting language,
Tk is Tcl with support for your windowing system.</t>

<t>To get a source or binary distribution for your system,
go to the
<eref target='http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.4.html'>Tcl Developer Xchange website</eref>
and install it.
If you get the binary distribution,
this is pretty simple.</t>

<figure>
<preamble>Of course,
you may already have Tcl version&nbsp;8.
To find out,
try typing this command from the shell
(or the &ldquo;MS-DOS Prompt&rdquo;):</preamble>
<artwork>
    % tclsh
</artwork>
<postamble>If the program launches,
you're good to go with Tcl version&nbsp;8.</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>If you are running under a windowing system (e.g., X or MS-Windows),
you can also try:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % wish
</artwork>
<postamble>If a new window comes up along with a &ldquo;Console&rdquo; window,
then you're good to go with Tk version&nbsp;8.</postamble>
</figure>

<t>Finally,
you may notice a file called <spanx style='verb'>xml2sgml.tcl</spanx>
in the distribution.
It contains some extra functionality for a few special users &mdash;
so, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it...</t>
</section>

<section title='Testing'>
<t>Now test your installation.</t>

<section title='Testing under a windowing system'>
<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % xml2rfc.tcl
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>A new window should come up that looks like this:</preamble>
<artwork align='center' src='xml2rfc-win.png'
                        alt='[&ldquo;Convert XML to RFC&rdquo; window]'
                        width='486' height='174'>

<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>

<preamble>and you should see these four lines:</preamble>
<artwork>
    invoke as "xml2rfc   inputfile outputfile"
           or "xml2txt   inputfile"
           or "xml2html  inputfile"
           or "xml2nroff inputfile"
</artwork>
</figure>
</section>
</section>

<section title='Next steps'>
<t>Read the <eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html'>2629bis</eref>
document.
In particular,
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#anchor13'>Section&nbsp;3</eref>
has some good information.</t>

<section anchor='processing.instructions' title='Processing Instructions'>
<figure>
<preamble>A <spanx style='emph'>processing instruction</spanx> contains
directives to an XML application.
If you want to give directives to <spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx>,
the processing instructions (PIs) look like this:</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc keyword='value'?&gt;
</artwork>
<postamble>Of course,
if you like the default behavior,
you don't need any behavior-modifying directives in your input file!
Although <spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx>
supports putting several attribute-like directives in one PI,
be warned that
<xref target='rfc2629.xslt'>rfc2629.xslt</xref>
does not support it and that there are issues in
doing this for a non-include-file directive following an
<xref target='include.file.facility'>include-file directive</xref>.
It is good practice to always surround the value with either
single or double quotes.</postamble>
</figure>

<section title='Option Settings'>
<texttable>
<preamble>The list of valid keywords are:</preamble>

<ttcol align='right'>keyword</ttcol>
<ttcol align='center'>default</ttcol>
<ttcol align='left'>meaning</ttcol>

<c>linkmailto</c>
<c>yes</c>
<c>generate mailto: URL, as appropriate</c>

<c>linefile</c>
<c>n/a</c>
<c>a string like "35:file.xml" or just "35"
(file name then defaults to the containing file's real name
or to the latest linefile specification that changed it)
that will be used to override <spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx>'s
reckoning of the current input position (right after this PI)
for warning and error reporting purposes (line numbers are 1-based)</c>

<c>needLines</c>
<c>n/a</c>
<c>an integer hint indicating how many contiguous lines are needed at this point in the output</c>

<c>private</c>
<c>""</c>
<c>produce a private memo rather than an RFC or Internet-Draft</c>

<c>slides</c>
<c>no</c>
<c>when producing a html file, produce multiple files for a slide show</c>

<c>sortrefs</c>
<c>no</c>
<c>sort references</c>

<c>strict</c>
<c>no</c>
<c>try to enforce the ID-nits conventions and DTD validity</c>

<c>subcompact</c>
<c>(compact)</c>
<c>if compact is "yes",
then you can make things a little less compact by setting this to "no"
(the default value is the current value of the compact PI)</c>

<c>symrefs</c>
<c>no</c>
<c>use anchors rather than numbers for references</c>

<c>3</c>
<c>if toc is "yes", then this determines the depth of the table-of-contents</c>

<c>tocindent</c>
<c>yes</c>
<c>if toc is "yes", then setting this to "yes" will indent subsections
in the table-of-contents</c>

<c>tocompact</c>
<c>yes</c>
<c>if toc is "yes", then setting this to "no" will make it a little less compact</c>

<c>tocnarrow</c>
<c>yes</c>
<c>affects horizontal spacing in the table-of-content</c>

<c>topblock</c>
<c>yes</c>
<c>put the famous header block on the first page</c>

<c>typeout</c>
<c>n/a</c>
<c>during processing pass&nbsp;2, print the value to standard output
at that point in processing</c>

<c>useobject</c>
<c>no</c>
<c>when producing a html file,
use the <spanx style='verb'>&lt;object&gt;</spanx> html element with inner replacement content
instead of the <spanx style='verb'>&lt;img&gt;</spanx> html element,
when a source xml element includes an <spanx style='verb'>src</spanx> attribute</c>

<postamble>Remember that,
as with everything else in XML,
keywords and values are case-sensitive.</postamble>
</texttable>

<t>With the exception of the <spanx style='verb'>needLines</spanx>,
<spanx style='verb'>typeout</spanx>, and
<spanx style='verb'>include</spanx> directives,
you normally put all of these processing instructions at the beginning
of the document
(right after the XML declaration).</t>
</section>

<section title='Include Files' anchor='include.file.facility'>
<figure>
<preamble><spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx> has an include-file facility,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc include='file'?&gt;
</artwork>
<postamble><spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx> will consult the
<spanx style='verb'>XML_LIBRARY</spanx> environment variable for a
search path of where to look for files.
(If this environment variable isn't set,
the directory containing the file that contains the include-file
directive is used.)
The file's contents are inserted right after the PI.
Putting non-include-file directives (especially needLines ones)
after an include-file one in the same PI
may not work as expected because of this.
Remember that file names are generally case-sensitive and that
an input file that is distributed to the outside world may be
processed on a different operating system than that used by
its author.</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>You can also have <spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx> set
the <spanx style='verb'>XML_LIBRARY</spanx> environment variable directly,
by creating a file called <spanx style='verb'>.xml2rfc.rc</spanx> in
the directory where your
main file is,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork><![CDATA[
global env tcl_platform

if {![string compare $tcl_platform(platform) windows]} {
    set sep ";"
} else {
    set sep ":"
}

if {[catch { set env(XML_LIBRARY) } library]} {
    set library ""
    foreach bibxmlD [lsort -dictionary \
                           [glob -nocomplain $HOME/rfcs/bibxml/*]] {
        append library $sep$bibxmlD
    }
}

set nativeD [file nativename $inputD]
if {[lsearch [split $library $sep] $nativeD] < 0} {
    set library "$nativeD$sep$library"
}

set env(XML_LIBRARY) $library
]]></artwork>
</figure>

<t>There are links to various bibliographic databases (RFCs, I-Ds, and so on)
on the <spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx>
<eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>homepage</eref>.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section title='The Page Model'>
<t>The <spanx style='strong'>html</spanx>
rendering engine does not need to
have a tightly defined page model.</t>

<t>The <spanx style='strong'>txt</spanx> and
<spanx style='strong'>nr</spanx> rendering engines
assume the following page model.</t>

<t>Each line has at most 72 columns from the left edge,
including any left margin, but excluding the line terminator.
Every output character is from the ASCII repertoire
and the only control character used is the line-feed (LF);
the character-tabulation (HT) character is never used.</t>

<t>Each page has the following lines
(in 1-based numbering, as reported to the user, but contrary to
<spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx>'s
internal 0-based numbering):<list>
  <t>&nbsp;1:  header line (blank line on first page)</t>
  <t>&nbsp;2:  blank line</t>
  <t>&nbsp;3:  blank line</t>
  <t>&nbsp;4:  1st line of content</t>
  <t>...</t>
  <t>51:  48th line of content</t>
  <t>52:  blank line</t>
  <t>53:  blank line</t>
  <t>54:  blank line</t>
  <t>55:  footer line</t>
  <t>56:  form-feed character (followed by line terminator)</t>
</list>
Once processed through <spanx style='strong'>nroff</spanx>
and the <spanx style='verb'>fix.sh</spanx> script (from
<eref target='ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc-editor/2-nroff.template'
>2-nroff.template</eref>), the <spanx style='strong'>nr</spanx>
output differs from this in two ways.
It has three extra blank lines
(that could be numbered -2, -1, and 0, for a total of six)
at the very beginning of the document
(so the first page is that much longer).
It also has no line terminator following the
very last form-feed character of the file.
These differences originate in the design of
the <spanx style='verb'>fix.sh</spanx> script.</t>

<t>Header and footer lines each have three parts:
left, center, and right.</t>
</section>

<section title='Additions to RFC&nbsp;2629'>
<t>A few additions have been made to the format originally defined in
RFC&nbsp;2629.
In particular,
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#anchor19'>Appendix&nbsp;C</eref>
of the 2629bis document enumerates the additions.</t>

<t>In addition,
<spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx> recognizes the undocumented
<spanx style='verb'>src</spanx>,
<spanx style='verb'>alt</spanx>,
<spanx style='verb'>width</spanx>, and
<spanx style='verb'>height</spanx> attributes in the
<spanx style='verb'>figure</spanx> and
<spanx style='verb'>artwork</spanx> elements,
but only if HTML is being generated.
Here are two examples, one for each case.</t>
<figure>
<preamble>Here, the attributes are added to the
<spanx style='verb'>artwork</spanx> element.</preamble>
<artwork align='center'><![CDATA[
<figure>
    <preamble>This is the preamble.</preamble>
    <artwork src='layers.png'

.-----------.
| ASCII art |
`-----------'
</artwork>
    <postamble>This is the postamble.</postamble>
</figure>
]]></artwork>
<postamble>In this case, the 
<spanx style='verb'>preamble</spanx> and
<spanx style='verb'>postamble</spanx> elements are kept and
an <spanx style='verb'>img</spanx> tag is placed in the HTML output
to replace the whole <spanx style='verb'>artwork</spanx> element
and its textual drawing, which are ignored.</postamble>
</figure>
<figure>
<preamble>Here, the attributes are added to the
<spanx style='verb'>figure</spanx> element.</preamble>
<artwork align='center'><![CDATA[
<figure src='layers.png'
        alt='[picture of layers and explanation]'>
    <preamble>This is the preamble.</preamble>
    <artwork>
.-----------.
| ASCII art |
`-----------'
</artwork>
    <postamble>This is the postamble.</postamble>
</figure>
]]></artwork>
<postamble>In this case,
an <spanx style='verb'>img</spanx> tag is placed in the HTML output
to replace the whole contents of the
<spanx style='verb'>figure</spanx> element
(the <spanx style='verb'>preamble</spanx>,
     <spanx style='verb'>artwork</spanx>, and
     <spanx style='verb'>postamble</spanx> inner elements
 and the textual drawing itself)
which are ignored.</postamble>
</figure>

<t><spanx style='strong'>xml2rfc</spanx> also recognizes
an undocumented <spanx style='verb'>align</spanx> attribute
(with possible values
 <spanx style='verb'>left</spanx>,
 <spanx style='verb'>center</spanx>, or
 <spanx style='verb'>right</spanx>)
in the
<spanx style='verb'>figure</spanx> and
<spanx style='verb'>artwork</spanx> elements.
It affects the whole content of the targeted element
for all types of generated output.
Its default is inherited from the parent of its element.</t>
</section>

<section title='Limitations of xml2rfc'>
<t><list style='symbols'>
<t>The <spanx style='verb'>figure</spanx> element's <spanx style='verb'>title</spanx> attribute is ignored,
except when generating HTML.</t>

<t>The <spanx style='verb'>xref</spanx> element's
<spanx style='verb'>pageno</spanx> attribute is ignored.</t>
