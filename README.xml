<section title='Introduction'>
<t>This is a package to convert memos written in XML to the RFC format.</t>

<t>If you don't want to install any software,
you can use the
<eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>web-based service</eref>.</t>
</section>

<section title='Requirements'>
<t>You need to have Tcl/Tk version 8 running on your system.
Tcl is a scripting language,
Tk is Tcl with support for your windowing system.</t>
    
<t>To get a source or binary distribution for your system,
go to the
<eref target='http://www.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/8.4.html'>Scriptics website</eref>
and install it.
If you get the binary distribution,
this is pretty simple.</t>
    
<figure>
<preamble>Of course,
you may already have Tcl version 8.
To find out,
try typing this command from the shell
(including the "MS-DOS Prompt"):</preamble>
<artwork>
    % tclsh
</artwork>
<postamble>If the program launches,
you're good to go with Tcl version 8.</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>If you are running under a windowing system (e.g., X or Windows),
you can also try:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % wish
</artwork>
<postamble>If a new window comes up along with a "Console" window,
then you're good to go with Tk version 8.</postamble>
</figure>

<t>Finally,
you may notice a file called |"xml2sgml.tcl| in the distribution.
It contains some extra functionality for a few special users &#151;
so, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it...</t>
</section>

<section title='Testing'>
<t>Now test your installation.</t>
    
<section title='Testing under a windowing system'>
<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % xml2rfc.tcl
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>A new window should come up that looks like this:</preamble>

<postamble>Fill-in the blanks and click on [Convert].</postamble>

<section title='Testing without a windowing system'>
<figure>
<preamble>Type this command from the shell:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % tclsh
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>If the program launches, type this command to it:</preamble>
<artwork>
    % source xml2rfc.tcl
</artwork>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>and you should see these four lines:</preamble>
<artwork>
    invoke as "xml2rfc   inputfile outputfile"
           or "xml2txt   inputfile"
           or "xml2html  inputfile"
           or "xml2nroff inputfile"
</artwork>
</figure>

<section title='Next steps'>
<t>Read the <eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html'>2629bis</eref>
document.
In particular,
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#anchor13'>Section 3</eref>
has some good information.</t>

<section title='Processing Instructions'>
<figure>
<preamble>A |*processing instruction| is a directive to an XML
application.
If you want to give directives to |'xml2rfc|,
the PIs look like this:</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc keyword='value'?>
</artwork>
</figure>

<section title='Option Settings'>
<figure>
<preamble>The list of valid keywords are:</preamble>
<artwork>
    keyword     default     meaning
    =======     =======     =======
    compact     no          when producing a .txt file, try to
                            conserve vertical whitespace
    
    subcompact  compact     if compact is "yes", then setting
                            this to "no" will make things a 
                            little less compact

    toc         no          generate a table-of-contents

    tocompact   yes         if toc is "yes", then setting this to
                            "no" will make it a little less compact

    editing     no          insert editing marks for ease of
                            discussing draft versions

    private     ""          produce a private memo rather than
                            an RFC or Internet-Draft.

    header      ""          override the leftmost header string

    footer      ""          override the center footer string

    slides      no          when producing an .html file, produce
                            multiple files for a slide show

    sortrefs    no          sort references

    symrefs     no          use anchors rather than numbers for
                            references

    background  ""          when producing an .html file, use this
                            image
</artwork>
<postamble>Remember,
that as with everything else in XML,
keywords and values are case-sensitive.</postamble>
</figure>
</section>

<section title='Include Files'>
<figure>
<preamble>|'xml2rfc| has an include-file facility,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork>
    &lt;?rfc include='file'?>
</artwork>
<postamble>|'xml2rfc| will consult the $XML_LIBRARY environment variable
for a search path of where to look for files.
(If this envariable isn't set,
the directory containing the file that contains the include-file
directive is used.)</postamble>
</figure>

<figure>
<preamble>You can also have |'xml2rfc| set this envariable directly,
by including a file called |".xml2rfc.rc| in the directory where your
main file is,
e.g.,</preamble>
<artwork><![CDATA[
global env

if {![info exists env(XML_LIBRARY)]} {
    set env(XML_LIBRARY) \
        ";\\home\\rfcs\\include;\\home\\rfcs\\bibxml"
}
set nativeD [file nativename $inputD]
if {[lsearch [split $env(XML_LIBRARY) ";"] $nativeD] < 0} {
    set env(XML_LIBRARY) "$nativeD;$env(XML_LIBRARY)"
}
]]></artwork>
<postamble>which,
on Windows,
sets the envariable to a default value,
and then inserts, at the front,
the directory where your main file is.</postamble>
</figure>

<t>There are links to various bibliographic databases (RFCs, I-Ds, and so on)
on the |'xml2rfc| <eref target='http://xml.resource.org/'>homepage</eref>.</t>

<section title='Additions to RFC 2629'>
<t><list style='symbols'>
<t>The |'artwork| element has an undocumented |'src| attribute that is
consulted only if slides are being generated,
e.g.,
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
       <figure><artwork src='layers.gif' /></figure>
]]></artwork>
</figure></t>

<t>The |'artwork| element has optional |'name| and |'type| attributes.</t>

<t>The |'references| element may occur more than once in the |'back| element
(e.g., for normative and non-normative references).
Further,
the element has an optional |'title| attribute.</t>

<t>The value of the |'list| element's |'style| attribute can start with
|""format "|.</t>

<t>If the |'style| attribute of the |'list| element has either of the
values |""hanging"| or |""format"|,
then a second,
optional attribute,
called |'hangIndent| is consulted.</t>
</list>
For more information on these last two additions,
see Section 2.3.1.2 of the
<eref target='draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html#list'>2629bis</eref>
document for the details.</t>
</section>

<section title='Limitations'>
<t><list style='symbols'>
<t>The |'figure| element's |'title| attribute is ignored,
except when generating HTML.</t>

<t>The |'xref| element's |'pageno| attribute is ignored.</t>
</list></t>
