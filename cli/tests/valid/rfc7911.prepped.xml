In particular, a new advertisement for a given address prefix and a given Path Identifier replaces a previous advertisement for the same address prefix and Path Identifier. If a BGP speaker receives a message to withdraw a prefix with a Path Identifier not seen before, it SHOULD silently ignore it.</t>
      <t keepWithNext="false" keepWithPrevious="false" pn="section-5-2">For a BGP speaker to be able to send multiple paths to its peer, that BGP speaker MUST advertise the ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/Receive field set to either 2 or 3, and MUST receive from its peer the ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/Receive field set to either 1 or 3, for the corresponding &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.</t>

The peer SHALL act accordingly in processing an UPDATE message related to a particular &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.</t>

If the exchange is successful <xref format="default" target="RFC5492" displayFormat="of" pageno="false" derivedContent="RFC5492"/>, then the BGP speakers will be able to process all BGP UPDATES properly, as described in <xref target="ops" format="default" displayFormat="of" pageno="false" derivedContent="Section 5"/>.  However, if, for example, a packet analyzer is used on the wire to examine an active BGP session, it may not be able to properly decode the BGP UPDATES because it lacks prior knowledge of the exchanged Capabilities.</t>
      <t keepWithNext="false" keepWithPrevious="false" pn="section-6-3">When deployed as a provider edge router or a peering router that interacts with external neighbors, a BGP speaker usually advertises at most one path to the internal neighbors in a network.

A new BGP capability, termed "Graceful Restart Capability", is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.  Finally, procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.</t>
