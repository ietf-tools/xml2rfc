                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                      draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocabulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series described in
   [RFC6949].  The new series will have multiple formats: the canonical
   document will be in XML using the v3 format described here, and many
   non-canonical formats (such as HTML and text) will be generated as
   well.  The generation of these non-canonical formats means that there
   will be much more emphasis put on the processor that handles the XML.
   Features of the expected processor are described in Appendix B.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The following is a hopefully-complete list of all the technical
   changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document.  Note that the list is
   for the current version of this document only.  There are additional
   changes that are expected to the v3 vocabulary that are being
   discussed.  Also note that changes to the design choices for the
   differences are also expected.

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      format for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually, but it
      is likely to be years away.

   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant
   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   described in [XML2RFCv2].

   The canonical RFCs will not have any markup that uses a deprecated
   feature.  The processor described in Appendix B will have a "convert
   with warnings" mode that will convert a v2 document to a v3 document
   that converts deprecated features wherever possible, issuing warnings
   for where it cannot convert.  The processor will also have a "strict"
   mode that will issue errors if any deprecated features are in the
   input.

   The list of changes so far is:

   o  Did not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead directly from
      the Relax Next Generation (RNG) grammar.

   o  In <address>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.

   o  In <artwork> and <author>, added optional "xml:lang" attribute.

   o  Allowed <artwork> to be in a <section>, not just a figure.

   o  Deprecated "xml:space" in <artwork> because there was only one
      useful value.

   o  Gave more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  Added the <b>, <i>, and <tt> elements.

   o  Added the <blockquote> element.

   o  Allowed <b>, <eref>, <i>, <tt>, and <xref> in <cref>.

   o  Deprecated <facsimile> because it is rarely used and is not
      actually useful.

   o  Deprecated the "alt", "height", "src", and "width" attributes in
      <figure> because they overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   o  Allowed more than one <artwork> in <figure>.

   o  In <front>, made <date> optional.

   o  Added <innerRefContent> to allow better control of text in a
      reference.

   o  Deprecated <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.

   o  Deprecated <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  In <postal>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allowed the inclusion of <postalline> instead of the older
      elements.  Also added optional "xml:lang" attribute.

   o  Added <postalline>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

   o  Changed the handling of <reference>.  This large change is
      described in Section 1.1.1.  Also, allowed the elements inside a
      <reference> to be in any order.

   o  Added "sortRefs", "symRefs", "tocDepth", and "tocInclude"
      attributes in the <rfc> element to cover PIs that were in v2 that
      are still needed in the grammar.

   o  In <section>, added the optional "numbered" and "removeinrfc"
      attributes.  Also deprecated "title" in favor of <sectiontitle>.

   o  Deprecated <spanx> element, and replaced it with <b>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  Added the <tindent> element for indented paragraphs.

   o  In <ttcol>, added <xref>, <eref>, <iref>, and <cref> as optional
      children.

   o  Deprecated <vspace> because the v2 spec labeled it as "a purely
      presentational element and thus its use ought to be avoided".

   o  Deprecated the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecated the "none" and "title" values for the "format"
      attribute in <xref> because the former makes no sense semantically
      and the latter because it has unpredictable output.

   o  Added the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Added "ascii" attributes to <author>, <email>, and <organization>
      elements.  This allows an author to specify their information in
      their native scripts as the primary entry and still allow the
      ASCII-equivalent values to appear in the processed documents.

   o  Added "autogeneratedBoilerplateText",
      "autogeneratedSectionNumber", "autogeneratedFigureNumber", and
      "autogeneratedTableNumber" attributes to <rfc>, <section>,
      <figure>, and <texttable>, respectively.  These will be filled in
      by the RFC processor so that the canonical XML file has all of the
      same information as the non-canonical formats.

1.1.1.  Design for Changes in Reference Handling

   This section describes one of the larger changes in the design of v3,
   namely the additions to make using references easier.  Most
   references in most recent RFCs are just to RFCs; sometimes they are
   Internet Drafts as work-in-progress; much less often they are
   pointers to standards of other SDOs, research articles, or just plain
   URIs.  There have been many complaints about how difficult it is for
   people who don't have strong XML skills to use references when making
   Internet Drafts.

   The two popular methods now for references to RFCs are entering the
   whole reference by hand (hopefully getting all the fiddly bits of
   <front> and <seriesInfo> correct), or using XML entities that call
   out to xml.resource.org.  Both work, but both have their faults.  The
   first requires good copying skills and sometimes causes difficult XML
   errors; the second prevents you from changing the anchor name and,
   less importantly, also requires that you be online when you run the
   xml2rfc processor.

   To make entering references easier for the vast majority of cases,
   the following changes have been made in the v3 vocabulary:

   o  The <reference> element can take another optional pair of
      attributes: "series" and "document".  For example, the value for
      "series" would be "id", "rfc", "fyi", "bcp", and "std" for
      Internet-Drafts, RFCs, and the BCP, FYI, and STD subseries; there
      would be many series for other documents as well.  The value for
      "document" depends on the series, as described in <reference>.

   o  Instead of using the "series" and "document" attributes, the
      document author can instead use the "includeFile" or "includeURI"
      attributes.  The "includeFile" attribute tells the processor that
      the XML for this reference is actually in a file on the local
      disk; the "includeURI" attribute tells the processor that the XML
      for this reference is actually needs to be retrieved from the web.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   o  The processor would emit a properly-formatted output for the
      reference in the non-canonical display formats based on rules
      built into the processor and data for the references.  The library
      used for expansion of the references will be maintained by the RFC
      Editor.

   o  Thus, the contents of <reference> changes from requiring a <front>
      element to making the <front> element optional if the
      "series"/"document" pair of attributes is given, or if the entire
      reference is retrieved from disk or from a URL.

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, the
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]).  In short, it is a text string with no spaces
   or colons; hyphens and underscores are allowed.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  See [RFCSTYLE] for more
   information on restrictions for the abstract.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.49)

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.25)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>.
   The list at the time that this document is being published is:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",
   "Transport", "tsv", but that list will likely change over time.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.

   This element appears as child element of: <blockquote> (Section 2.9),
   <dd> (Section 2.16), <figure> (Section 2.22), <li> (Section 2.29),

   (Section 2.51).

   Content model:

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     April 2014


   the graphics file is wholly part of the XML file.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A processor
   might add type-specific formatting to artwork with the preferred
   values in the non-canonical output formats.  If the processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning.

   The beginning list of preferred values are:

   o  abnf

   o  ascii-art

   o  asn.1

   o  bash

   o  c++

   o  c

   o  call-flow

   o  hex-dump

   o  mib

   o  perl

   o  python

   o  svg

   The RFC Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.5.9.  'xml:space' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".  For RFCs, it is the
   stream that determines who is listed as authors or editors.

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model:

2.6.2.  'fullname' attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.6.3.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

2.6.4.  'role' attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.6.5.  'surname' attribute

   The author's surname.

2.6.6.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.7.  <b>

   Causes the text to be displayed in a bold font.

2.14.  <cref>

   Represents a comment.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work-in-progress.
   They usually appear either inline and visually highlighted, at the

2.14.1.  'anchor' attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.  The processor will
   auto-generate an identifier when none is given.

2.14.2.  'source' attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.15.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the
   document being produced, and also inside bibliographic references.

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are left out,
   the processor will attempt to use the current system date if the
   attributes that are specified do match the system date.

   Note that month names need to match the full (English) month name
   ("January", "February", "March", "April", "May, "June", "July",
   "August", "September", "October", "November", or "December") in order
   for expiration calculations to work (some implementations might
   support additional formats, though).

   In the second case, the date information will be embedded as-is into
   the reference text.  Therefore, also vague dates ("ca. 2000"), date
   ranges, and so on, are allowed.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.15.1.  'day' attribute

2.33.2.  'start' attribute

   The ordinal value to start the list at.  This defaults to "1".

2.33.3.  'style' attribute

   The style of the labels on list items.  If the length of the style
   value is 1, the meaning is the same as it is for HTML:

   a  Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   A  Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   1  Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   i  Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   I  Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   If the length of the style value is greater than 1, the value must
   contain a percent-encoded indicator and other text.  The value is a
   free-form text that allows counter values to be inserted using a
   "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]" generates labels of
   the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item number as decimal
   number.

   The following formats are supported:

   %c Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   %C Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   %d Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   %i Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   %I Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   %% Represents a percent sign

   Other formats are reserved for future use.

2.34.  <organization>

   This information appears in both the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page (see [RFCSTYLE] for more information).  If the
   value is long, an abbreviated variant can be specified in the
   "abbrev" attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model: only text content.

2.34.1.  'abbrev' attribute

2.34.2.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the organization's name.

2.35.  <phone>

   Represents a phone number.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.36.  <postal>

   Contains optional child elements providing postal information.  These
   elements will be displayed in an order that is processor-specific.  A
   postal address can contain only a set of <street>, <city>, <region>,
   <code>, and <country> elements, or only an ordered set of

2.40.  <reference>

   Represents a bibliographical reference.

   The reference can be expressed in one of four ways:

      As a <front> element plus optional <seriesInfo>, <format>, and
      <annotation> elements.

      As a pair of attributes: "series" and "document".

      As a "includeFile" attribute that points to XML that is in a file
      on the local disk.

      As a "includeURI" attribute that points to XML that is retrieved
      from the web.

   In the latter method, the document does not need to contain any
   specifics for the reference other than a simple specification of the
   reference.

   For example, a reference to RFC 6068 is given as either:

   The processor needs to make sure that exactly zero or one of "series"
   is given.  It has to do a sanity check on the "document" value to be
   sure that the value is valid for the "series".  If the "series" value
   is "bcp" or "std", the processor needs to check if the list in the
   "document" list matches the present or a previous set of values for
   the BCP or STD.

2.40.1.  'anchor' attribute (mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the references section,

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.41.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative" as described
   in [RFCSTYLE]).  This vocabulary supports the split with the "title"
   attribute.

   Provides the title for the References section (defaulting to
   "References").

   In general, the title should be either "Normative References" or
   "Informative References".

2.42.  <region>

   Provides the region name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.36).

   Content model: only text content.

2.43.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   2.  One <middle> element (Section 2.31)

   3.  One optional <back> element (Section 2.8)

2.43.1.  'autogeneratedBoilerplateText' attribute

   The full boilerplate text for this document.  This attribute and its
   value are automatically generated by the RFC Processor, and are
   ignored by other processors.  If the value already exists when the
   RFC Processor is run, it is replaced.

2.43.2.  'category' attribute

   Document category (see Appendix A.1).

   Allowed values:

   o  "std"

   o  "bcp"

   o  "no"

   o  "yes"

2.43.4.  'docName' attribute

   For Internet-Drafts, this specifies the draft name (which appears

   Note that the file extension is not part of the draft, so in general
   it should end with the current draft number ("-", plus two digits).

   Furthermore, it is good practice to disambiguate current editor
   copies from submitted drafts (for instance, by replacing the draft
   number with the string "latest").

   See [IDGUIDE] for further information.

2.43.8.  'obsoletes' attribute

   A comma-separated list of RFC numbers or Internet-Draft names.

   This element is used to specify the Working Group (IETF) or Research
   Group (IRTF) from which the document originates, if any.  The
   recommended format is the official name of the Working Group (with
   some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property on the <rfc>

2.59.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part.

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand
   what is being referred to.

   Content model: only text content.

2.59.1.  'format' attribute

   This attribute is used to control the format of the generated
   reference text.

   "counter"

      Inserts just a counter; this use used for the number of a section,
      figure, or table.  For example:

     <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
     . . .
     See Section <xref target="overview" format="counter"/>
     for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "default"

      Inserts a text fragment that describes the referenced part
      completely, such as "Section 2" or "Table 4" for internal links,
      or "[XML]" for links to references.  For example:

     <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
     . . .
     See <xref target="overview"/> for an overview.

      might generate

     See Section 1.7 for an overview.

   "none"

      This attribute value is deprecated.

   "title"

   Allowed values:

   o  "counter"

   o  "title"

   o  "none"

   o  "default" (default)

2.59.2.  'pageno' attribute

   Deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.59.3.  'relative' attribute

   Specifies a relative reference from the main target. [[anchor3: NEED
   MORE DESCRIPTION HERE ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE DISPLAYED.]]

2.59.4.  'section' attribute

   Specifies a section for the generated reference.  For example,

        See <xref section="2.3" target="RFC6949"/> for more inforation.

   would generate

        See Section 2.3 of [RFC6949] for more information.

2.59.5.  'sectionFormat' attribute

   The format that the section reference will be displayed in.  The
   acceptable values are:

   o  "of" (default)

   o  "comma"

   o  "parens"

     for more inforation.
     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.4" sectionFormat="comma"/>
     for more inforation.
     See <xref target="RFC6949" section="2.5" sectionFormat="parens"/>
     for more inforation.

        See Section 2.3 of [RFC6949] for more information.
        See [RFC6949], Section 2.4 for more information.
        See [RFC6949] (Section 2.5) for more information.

2.59.6.  'target' attribute (mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.

   The value needs to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of
   another element in the document.

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   Although the current RFC format does not allow non-ASCII Unicode
   characters ([UNICODE]), some of them can be used to enforce certain
   behaviors of formatters.

   For instance:

   non-breaking space (U+00A0)

      Represents a space character where no line break should happen.
      This is frequenly used in titles (by excluding certain space
      characters from the line breaking algorithm, the processor will
      use the remaining whitespace ocurrences for line breaks).

   non-breaking hyphen (U+2011)

      Similarly, this represents a hyphen character where nevertheless
      no line breaking ought to occur.

   word joiner (U+2060)

      Also called "zero width non-breaking space".  This can be used to
      disallow line breaking between two non-whitespace characters.

   Note that in order to use these characters by name, they need to be

   declared either in the Document Type Definition (DTD, [XML], Section
   2.9), or in the "internal subset" ([XML], Section 2.8), like this:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>

   <!DOCTYPE rfc [

     <!-- declare nbsp and friends -->
     <!ENTITY nbsp    "&#xa0;">
     <!ENTITY nbhy    "&#x2011;">
     <!ENTITY wj      "&#x2060;">
   ]>

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII
   [USASCII] characters ([RFC2223], Section 3).  Future versions are
   likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the vocabulary
   will be extended so that US-ASCII alternatives can be provided when
   that makes sense (for instance, in contact information).

5.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [XML2RFCv2].  The following is
   to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further
   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
      the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.

Appendix B.  The v3 Format and Processors

   As described in [RFC6949], the v3 format will be the format for
   canonical RFCs.  The format will also likely be allowed for
   submission of Internet Drafts.  The format for both of these tasks is
   the same; however, software processing an XML file for creation of an
   Internet Draft will act differently than it will for creation of what
   is expected to be an RFC.

   This section describes topics that ares specific to processors.  Note
   that there is some discussion of processors in the main body of the
   document as well.  For example, some elements have descriptions of
   how a processor might create output from the element.

   This section differentiates between three types of processors:

   o  RFC Processor -- The processor used by the RFC Editor to validate
      the contents of the intended RFC and to create the non-canonical
      formats.

   o  Draft Processor -- The processor used by the IETF to validate the
      contents of XML that is submitted and to create the other formats
      that will be supported for Internet Drafts.

   o  Private Processors -- There may be processors that are meant to
      run on the computers of authors that create documents in formats
      different than those supported by the RFC Editor and the Internet
      Drafts repository.

   It is expected that a single piece of software will be used for both
   the RFC Processor and the Draft Processor, with different application
   settings to differentiate between them.  For example, some XML that
   is valid for Internet Drafts will not be valid for canonical RFCs, so
   the Draft Processor can be set to give warnings for those features
   but the RFC Processor can be set to give hard errors.

   Users of current and older XML processors for Internet Drafts and
   RFCs may be used to them having unhelpful error messages.  Beginning
   with v3, the RFC Processor and Draft Processor will have much better
   error reporting, giving more context than just a line number.  For
   example, the error messages will differentiate between errors in XML
   and those from the v3 format.

   The new processor can also help in the transition from the v2 format
   to the v3 format.  A user could request that the processor convert a
   v2 document to v3, using the new features of v3 where appropriate,
   and removing the parts that are no longer supported.  The processor
   might be able to fully convert a v2 document to v3, or it might have
   to only give advice on some of the v2 features that could not be
   automatically converted.

B.1.  The RFC Processor

   The canonical format for RFCs have a number of restrictions that the
   RFC Processor needs to enforce before a document can be published in
   its final form.  In this "final" mode, the processor will give a hard
   error when an input XML file has:

   o  any element or attribute listed as "deprecated" in the v3
      vocabulary

   o  XML comments

   o  XML Processor Instructions (PIs)

   o  an external DTD

   o  ENTITYs that have a SYSTEM component

   o  <artwork> elements with a "src" attribute that points to a URI
      with a scheme other than "data:"

   o  <cref> elements

   The RFC Processor will also have a mode that gives hard errors on all
   of the above other than <cref> elements.  This is to allow the RPC to
   insert <cref> elements in the working XML for notes to authors in
   AUTH 48, notes to IANA, and so on.

   The RFC Processor will also generate values for
   "autogeneratedBoilerplateText", "autogeneratedSectionNumber",
   "autogeneratedFigureNumber", and "autogeneratedTableNumber"
   attributes in <rfc>, <section>, <figure>, and <texttable>,
   respectively.

B.2.  Processor Instructions

   In the v2 format, XML PIs were used for a wide variety of tasks,
   including changing some formatting of the text outputs, adding
   information to HTML versions of Internet Drafts, and specifying other
   instructions to processors.  In the v3 format, a much smaller set of
   PIs is supported for the Draft Processor and Private Processors.  It
   is important to note that canonical RFCs will not contain any PIs.

   The following PIs will be supported by the Draft Processor:

   o  editing -- When set ot "yes", causes the processor to insert
      reference numbers throughout the output files to allow ease of
      referral to particular paragraphs or artwork in the text.  The
      default is "no".

   The following PIs will not be supported by the Draft Processor, but
   are included so that Private Processors have a common way of
   referring to them:

   o  comments -- When set to "yes", causes all <cref> elements to be
      rendered in the output files.  The default is "yes".

   o  include -- Allows the author to combine other files into the XML
      file to complete the document. argument can be a local file name
      (with a possible prefix from the environment variables on the
      computer) or a URI.

   o  linefile -- Causes the processor to emit more detailed information
      about which line of which input file caused an error or warning.

   Note that a Private Processor can have its own PIs.
