                   The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary
                      draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the 'XML2RFC' version 3 vocabulary; an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     March 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ('v3') of the 'XML2RFC' vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ('Extensible Markup Language', [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFCSTYLE]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version ("v2") vocabulary [XML2RFCv2],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [XML2RFCv2] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

1.1.  Differences from v2 to v3

   The following is a hopefully-complete list of all the technical
   changes between [XML2RFCv2] and this document.  Note that the list is
   for the current version of this document only.  There are additional
   changes that are expected to the v3 vocabulary that are being
   discussed.  Also note that changes to the design choices for the
   differences are also expected.

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      format for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually, but it
      is likely to be years away.

   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense
   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant

   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   described in [XML2RFCv2].

   The canonical RFCs will not have any markup that uses a deprecated
   feature.  The RFC Editor's processor will have a "convert with
   warnings" mode that will convert a v2 document to a v3 document that
   converts deprecated features wherever possible, issuing warnings for
   where it cannot convert.  The processor will also have a "strict"
   mode that will issue errors if any deprecated features are in the
   input.

   The list of changes so far is:

   o  Did not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead directly from
      the RNG grammar.

   o  In <address>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.

   o  In <artwork> and <author>, added optional "xml:lang" attribute.

   o  Allowed <artwork> to be in a <section>, not just a figure.

   o  Deprecated "xml:space" in <artwork> because there was only one
      useful value.

   o  Gave more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  Added the <b>, <i>, and <tt> elements.

   o  Added the <blockquote> element.

   o  Allowed <b>, <eref>, <i>, <tt>, and <xref> in <cref>.

   o  Deprecated <facsimile> because it is rarely used and is not
      actually useful.

   o  Deprecated the "alt", "height", "src", and "width" attributes in
      <figure> because they overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

   o  Allowed more than one <artwork> in <figure>.

   o  In <front>, made <date> optional.

   o  Added <innerRefContent> to allow better control of text in a
      reference.

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     March 2014


   o  Deprecated <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.

   o  Deprecated <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  In <postal>, allowed the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allowed the inclusion of <postalline> instead of the older
      elements.

   o  Added <postalline>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

   o  Changed the handling of <reference>.  This large change is
      described in Section 1.1.1.

   o  Allowed the elements inside a <reference> to be in any order.

   o  In <section>, added the optional "numbered" and "removeinrfc"
      attributes.

   o  Deprecated <spanx> element, and replaced it with <b>, <i>, and
      <tt>.

   o  Added the <tindent> element for indented paragraphs.

   o  In <ttcol>, added <xref>, <eref>, <iref>, and <cref> as optional
      children.

   o  Deprecated <vspace> because the v2 spec labeled it as "a purely
      presentational element and thus its use ought to be avoided".

   o  Deprecated the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecated the "none" and "title" values for the "format"
      attribute in <xref> because the former makes no sense semantically
      and the latter because it has unpredictable output.

   o  Added the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Added "ascii" attributes to <author>, <email>, and <organization>
      elements.  This allows an athor to specify their information in
      their native scripts as the primary entry and still allow the
      ASCII-equivalent values to appear in the processed documents.

1.1.1.  Design for Changes in Reference Handling

   This section describes one of the larger changes in the design of v3,
   namely the additions to make using references easier.  Most
   references in most recent RFCs are just to RFCs; sometimes they are
   Internet Drafts as work-in-progress; much less often they are
   pointers to standards of other SDOs, research articles, or just plain
   URLs.  There have been many complaints about how difficult it is for
   people who don't have strong XML skills to use references when making
   Internet Drafts.

   The two popular methods now for references to RFCs are entering the
   whole reference by hand (hopefully getting all the fiddly bits of
   <front> and <seriesInfo> correct), or using XML entities that call
   out the xml.resource.org.  Both work, but both have their faults.
   The first requires good copying skills and sometimes causes difficult
   XML errors; the second prevents you from changing the anchor name
   and, less importantly, also requires that you be online when you run
   the xml2rfc processor.

   To make entering references easier for the vast majority of cases,
   the following changes have been made in the v3 vocabulary:

   o  The <reference> element can take another optional pair of
      attributes: "series" and "document".  For example, the value for
      "series" would be "rfc", "fyi", "id", "bcp", and "std" for IETF-
      controlled documents; there would be many series for non-IETF
      documents as well.  The value for "document" depends on the
      series, as described in <reference>.

   o  The processor would emit a properly-formatted output for the
      reference in the non-canonical display formats based on rules
      built into the processor and data for the references.  The library
      used for expansion of the references will be maintained by the RFC
      Editor.

   o  Thus, the contents of <reference> changes from requiring a <front>
      element to making the <front> element optional if a "series" is
      given.

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix B (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, "RNC").

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the

   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, The
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]).  In short, it is a text string with no spaces
   or colons; hyphens and underscores are allowed.

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the abstract of the document.  The abstract ought to be
   self-contained and thus should not contain references or unexpanded
   abbreviations.  See [RFCSTYLE] for more information.

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.48)

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  <postal> elements (Section 2.36)

   o  <phone> elements (Section 2.35)

   o  <facsimile> elements (Section 2.21)

   o  <email> elements (Section 2.19)

   o  <uri> elements (Section 2.55)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.

   For instance:

   <annotation>
     Latest version available at <eref
     target='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml'/>.
   </annotation>

   ...will generate the text used in the reference for [XML].

   This element appears as child element of: <reference> (Section 2.40).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.58)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.20)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.14)

   o  <spanx> elements (Section 2.46)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.52)

   o  <b> elements (Section 2.7)

   o  <i> elements (Section 2.25)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area this document applies to
   (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the fullname or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>:
   "Applications", "app", "General", "gen", "Internet", "int",
   "Operations and Management", "ops", "Real-time Applications and
   Infrastructure", "rai", "Routing", "rtg", "Security", "sec",

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" into the document.

   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks, and thus is used for a variety of things, such as:

   o  diagrams ("line art"),

   o  source code,

   o  formal languages (such as ABNF or the RNC notation used in this
      document),

   o  complex tables, or

   o  protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a bitmap or a vector drawing.  In this case,
   the textual content acts as fallback for output formats that do not
   support graphics, and thus ought to contain either a "line art"
   variant of the graphics, or otherwise prose that describes the
   included image in sufficient detail.  Note that RFCs occasionally are
   published with enhanced diagrams; a recent example is [RFC5598].

   This element appears as child element of: <blockquote> (Section 2.9),
   <dd> (Section 2.16), <figure> (Section 2.22), <li> (Section 2.29),
   <section> (Section 2.44), <t> (Section 2.48), and <tindent>
   (Section 2.50).

   Text

2.5.1.  'align' attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left (default), centered, or
   right.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  'alt' attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (not just the caption).

2.5.3.  'height' attribute

   The suggested height of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.4.  'name' attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).

   This attribute generally isn't used for document generation, but it
   can be helpful for other kinds of tools (such as automated syntax
   checkers which work by extracting the source code).

2.5.5.  'src' attribute

   The URI of a graphics file.

   Note that this can be a "data" URI ([RFC2397]) as well, in which case
   the graphics file essentially is in-lined.

2.5.6.  'type' attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.  A processor
   might add type-specific formatting to artwork with the preferred
   values in the non-canonical output formats.  If the processor
   encounters a value for "type" that is not one of the preferred
   values, it can issue a warning.

   The beginning list of preferred values are:

   o  abnf

   o  bash

   o  c++

   o  c

   o  call-flow

   o  mib

   o  perl

   o  python

   The RFC Editor will mainatin a complete list of the preferred values
   on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over time.
   Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type.

2.5.7.  'width' attribute

   The suggested width of the graphics included using the "src"
   attribute.

   This attribute is format-dependent and ought to be avoided.

   When generating HTML output, current implementations copy the
   attribute "as is".  For other output formats it is usually ignored.

2.5.8.  'xml:lang' attribute

   Allows specification of the language used.  This is sometimes useful
   for renderers which display different fonts for CJK characters.

2.5.9.  'xml:space' attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <author>

   Provides information about a document author.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFCSTYLE]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in
   bibliographical references.  Note that this specification does not
   define a precise meaning for the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFCPOLICY] for more
   information.

2.6.3.  'initials' attribute

   Author initials (used on the front page and in references).

   Initials should be provided as a whitespace separated list of pairs
   of a letter and a dot.

   Note that this element is used both for the boilerplate of the

   In the first case, it defines the publication date, which, when
   producing Internet-Drafts, will be used for computing the expiration
   date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When "year", "month" or "day" are left out,
   the processor will attempt to use the current system date if the
   attributes that are specified do match the system date.

2.32.  <note>

   Creates an unnumbered section that appears after the abstract.

   It is usually used for additional information to reviewers (working
   group information, mailing list, ...), or for additional publication
   information such as "IESG Notes".

   This element appears as child element of: <front> (Section 2.24).

   Content model:

   One or more <t> elements (Section 2.48)

2.32.1.  'title' attribute (mandatory)

   The title of the note.

2.33.  <ol>

   An ordered list.  The labels on the items will be either a number or
   a letter, depending on the value of the style attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <dd> (Section 2.16), <li>
   (Section 2.29), and <t> (Section 2.48).

   Content model:

2.33.3.  'style' attribute

   The style of the labels on list items.  If the length of the style
   value is 1, the meaning is the same as it is for HTML:

   a  Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   A  Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   1  Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   i  Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   I  Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   If the length of the style value is greater than 1, the value must
   contain a percent-encoded indicator and other text.  The value is a
   free-form text that allows counter values to be inserted using a
   "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]" generates labels of
   the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item number as decimal
   number.

   The following formats are supported:

   %c Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   %C Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   %d Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   %i Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   %I Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   %% Represents a percent sign

   Other formats are reserved for future use.

2.34.  <organization>

   Specifies the affiliation of an author.

   This information appears in both the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page (see [RFCSTYLE] for more information).  If the
   value is long, an abbreviated variant can be specified in the
   "abbrev" attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <author> (Section 2.6).

2.34.1.  'abbrev' attribute

   Abbreviated variant.

2.34.2.  'ascii' attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the organization's name.

2.35.  <phone>

   Represents a phone number.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global numbers"
   syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as child element of: <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.36.  <postal>

   Contains optional child elements providing postal information.  These
   elements will be displayed in an order that is processor-specific.  A
   postal address can contain only a set of <street>, <city>, <region>,
   <code>, and <country> elements, or only an ordered set of
   <postalline> elements, but not both.

      As a pair of attributes: "series" and "document".

   In the latter method, the document does not need to contain any
   specifics for the reference other than a simple specification of the
   reference.

   For example, a refernence to RFC 6068 is given as either:

   <reference anchor="RFC6068">

   the BCP or STD.

   This element appears as child element of: <references>
   (Section 2.41).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.40.1.  'anchor' attribute (mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the references section,
   and as an identifier in links to this reference entry.

2.40.2.  'document' attribute (mandatory)

   The document or documents that make up a reference, as described
   earlier in this section.

2.40.3.  'series' attribute (mandatory)

   The series from which the referred-to document comes from, as
   described earlier in this section.

2.40.4.  'target' attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

   Note that depending on the <seriesInfo> element, a URI might not be
   needed, nor desirable, as it can be automatically generated (for
   instance, for RFCs).

2.41.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative" as described
   in [RFCSTYLE]).  This vocabulary supports the split with the "title"
   attribute.

   This element appears as child element of: <back> (Section 2.8).

   Content model:

   One or more <reference> elements (Section 2.40)

2.41.1.  'title' attribute

   Provides the title for the References section (defaulting to
   "References").

   In general, the title should be either "Normative References" or
   "Informative References".

2.42.  <region>

   Provides the region name in a postal address.

   This element appears as child element of: <postal> (Section 2.36).

   Content model: only text content.

2.43.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Processors distinguish between RFC mode ("number" attribute being
   present) and Internet-Draft mode ("docName" attribute being present):
   it is invalid to specify both.  Setting neither "number" nor
   "docName" can be useful for producing other types of document but is
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One <front> element (Section 2.24)

   2.  One <middle> element (Section 2.31)

   3.  One optional <back> element (Section 2.8)

2.43.1.  'category' attribute

   Document category (see Appendix A.1).

   Allowed values:

2.43.2.  'consensus' attribute

   Affects the generated boilerplate.

   See [RFC5741] for more information.

   Allowed values:

   o  "no"

   o  "yes"

2.43.3.  'docName' attribute

   For Internet-Drafts, this specifies the draft name (which appears
   below the title).

   Note that the file extension is not part of the draft, so in general
   it should end with the current draft number ("-", plus two digits).

   Furthermore, it is good practice to disambiguate current editor
   copies from submitted drafts (for instance, by replacing the draft
   number with the string "latest").

   See [IDGUIDE] for further information.

2.43.4.  'ipr' attribute

   Represents the Intellectual Property status of the document.  See
   Appendix A.2 for details.

   Allowed values:

   o  "full2026"

   o  "noDerivativeWorks2026"

   o  "none"

   o  "noDerivativesTrust200902"

   o  "pre5378Trust200902"

2.43.5.  'iprExtract' attribute

   Identifies a Section within the document for which extraction "as-is"
   is explicitly allowed (only relevant for historic values of the "ipr"
   attribute).

2.43.6.  'number' attribute

   The number of the RFC to be produced.

2.43.7.  'obsoletes' attribute

   A comma-separated list of RFC numbers or Internet-Draft names.

2.43.8.  'seriesNo' attribute

   When producing a document within document series (such as "STD"): the
   number within that series.

2.43.9.  'submissionType' attribute

   The document stream.

   Content model: only text content.

2.58.  <xref>

   Inserts a reference to a different part of a document.

   The generated text depends on whether the <xref> is empty (in which
   case the processor will try to generate a meaningful text fragment),
   and the nature of the referenced document part.

   Any element that allows the "anchor" attribute can be referenced,
   however there are restrictions with respect to the text content being
   generated.  For instance, a <t> can be a reference target, however,
   because paragraphs are not (visibly) numbered, the author will have
   to make sure that the prose is sufficient for a reader to understand
   what is being referred to.

   another element in the document.

3.  Special Unicode Code Points

   [[anchor4: Explain those code points where the processors implement
   something special, such as "nbsp".]]

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML], thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.

   However, the current canonical RFC format is restricted to US-ASCII

Internet-Draft                  XML2RFCv3                     March 2014


   [USASCII] characters ([RFC2223], Section 3).  Future versions are
   likely to relax this role, and it is expected that the vocabulary
   will be extended so that US-ACSII alternatives can be provided when
   that makes sense (for instance, in contact information).

5.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute on the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.4) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   Furthermore, all security considerations related to XML processing
   are relevant as well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet media types [BCP13] at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet media type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [XML2RFCv2].  The following is
   to be registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics as the charset parameter of the "application/xml" media
      type specified in [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 5.  In addition, as
      this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC3023].

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this media type:  Applications that either
      transform xml2rfc to output formats such as plain text or HTML,
      plus additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be uses as
      shorthand pointers, as described in Section 2.8 of [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in Section
         3.2 of [RFC3023].

      File extension(s):  .xml

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

Appendix A.  Front Page Generation

A.1.  The /rfc/@category Attribute

   For RFCs, the category determines the "maturity level" (see Section 4
   of [RFC2026]).  The allowed values are "std" for "Standards Track",
   "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for "Informational", "exp" for
   "Experimental", and "historic" for - surprise - "Historic".

   For Internet-Drafts, the category attribute is not needed, but will
   appear on the front page as "Intended Status".  Supplying this
   information can be useful to reviewers.

A.2.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document.  This attribute's values
   are not the result of a grand plan, but remain simply for historic
   reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in use; all
   others are supported by the various tools for backwards compatibility
   with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "day" attributes of the <date> element when archiving
      the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of submission.

   Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER.  For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Status Of This Memo" text, the submissionType
   attribute determines whether a statement about "Code Components" is
   inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF", which is the
   default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress this part of
   the text.

A.2.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "IETF TRUST Legal Provisions
   Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the "TLP, that
   went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).  Updates to this
   document were published on September 12, 2009 ([TLP3.0]) and on
   December 28, 2009 ([TLP4.0]), modifying the license for code
   components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for further

   information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text To Be
   Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "correct" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | TLP      | starting with publication date |
   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | [TLP3.0] | 2009-11-01                     |
   | [TLP4.0] | 2010-04-01                     |
   +----------+--------------------------------+

A.2.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.2.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published on
      the Standards Track.

A.2.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      Note: this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.2.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November
      10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in some of this

      material may not have granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
      modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
      Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s)
      controlling the copyright in such materials, this document may not
      be modified outside the IETF Standards Process, and derivative
      works of it may not be created outside the IETF Standards Process,
      except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate it
      into languages other than English.

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      Note: this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status Of This Memo".

A.2.2.  Historic Values

A.2.2.1.  Historic Values: '*trust200811'

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811" and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in <http://
   trustee.ietf.org/license-info/archive/
   IETF-Trust-License-Policy_11-10-08.pdf>.

A.2.2.2.  Historic Values: '*3978'

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

A.2.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

A.2.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet-Draft.
