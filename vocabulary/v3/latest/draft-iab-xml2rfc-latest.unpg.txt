                   The "xml2rfc" version 3 Vocabulary
                        draft-iab-xml2rfc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the "xml2rfc" version 3 vocabulary: an XML-
   based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is
   heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under
   discussion.  This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC
   2629 and its followup, RFC 7749.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes version 3 ("v3") of the "xml2rfc" vocabulary;
   an XML-based language ("Extensible Markup Language", [XML]) used for
   writing RFCs ([RFC7322]) and Internet-Drafts ([IDGUIDE]).

   This document obsoletes the version 2 vocabulary ("v2") [RFC7749],
   which contains the extended language definition.  That document in
   turn obsoletes the original version ("v1") [RFC2629].  This document
   directly copies the material from [RFC7749] where possible; as that
   document makes its way toward RFC publication, this document will
   incorporate as many of the changes as possible.

   The v3 format will be used as part of the new RFC series format
   described in [RFC6949].  The new format will be handled by one or
   more new tools for preparing the XML and converting it to other
   representations.  Features of the expected tools are described in
   Appendix B.  That section defines some terms used throughout this
   document, such as "prep tool" and "formatter".

   Note that the vocabulary contains certain constructs that might not
   be used when generating the final text; however, they can provide
   useful data for other uses (such as index generation, populating a
   keyword database, or syntax checks).

   In this document, the term "format" is used when describing types of
   documents, primarily XML and HTML.  The term "representation" is used
   when talking about a specific instatiation of a format, such as an
   XML document or an HTML document that was created by an XML document.

1.1.  Expected Updates to the Specification

   Non-interoperable changes in later versions of this specification are
   likely based on experience gained in implementing the RFC production
   center toolset.  Revised documents will be published capturing those
   changes as the toolset is completed.  Other implementers must not
   expect those changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details
   described in this document.

1.2.  Design Criteria for the Changes in v3

   The design criteria of the changes from v2 to v3 are:

   o  The intention is that starting and editing a v3 document will be
      easier than for a v2 document.

   o  There will be good v2-to-v3 conversion tools for when an author
      wants to change versions.

   o  There are no current plans to make v3 XML the required submission
      format for drafts or RFCs.  That might happen eventually, but it
      is likely to be years away.

   There is a desire to keep as much of the v2 grammar as makes sense
   within the above design criteria and not to make gratuitous changes
   to the v2 grammar.  Another way to say this is "we would rather
   encourage backward compatibility but not be constrained by it".
   Still, the goal of starting and editing a v3 document being easier
   than for a v2 document is more important than backwards compatibility
   with v2, given the latter two design criteria.

   v3 is upwards compatible with v2, meaning that a v2 document is meant
   to be a valid v3 document as well.  However, some features of v2 are
   deprecated in v3 in favor of new elements.  Deprecated features are
   listed in Section 1.3.3, and are described in [RFC7749].

1.3.  Differences from v2 to v3

   This is a a hopefully-complete list of all the technical changes
   between [RFC7749] and this document.

1.3.1.  New Elements in v3

   o  Add <dl>, <ul>, and <ol> as new ways to make lists.  This is a
      significant change from v2 in that the child under these elements
      is <li>, not <t>. <li> has a model of either containing one or
      more <t> elements, or containing the flowing text normally found
      in <t>.  These lists are children of <section>s and other lists
      instead of <t>.

   o  Add <strong>, <em>, <tt>, <sub>, and <sup> for character
      formatting.

   o  Add <aside> for incidental text that will be indented when
      displayed.

   o  Add <sourcecode> to differentiate from <artwork>.

   o  Add <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> to
      give table functionality like that in HTML.

   o  Add <boilerplate> to hold the automatically-generated boilerplate
      text.

   o  Add <blockquote> to indicate a quotation as in a paragraph-like
      format.

   o  Add <name> to sections, notes, figures, and texttables to allow
      character formatting (fixed-width font) in their titles, and to
      allow references in the names.

   o  Add <postalLine>, free text that represents one line of the
      address.

   o  Add <displayreference> to allow display of more mnemonic anchor
      names for automatically-included references.

   o  Add <refcontent> to allow better control of text in a reference.

   o  Add <referencegroup> to allow referencing multi-RFC documents such
      as STDs and BCPs.

   o  Add <relref> to allow referencing specific sections or anchors in
      references.

   o  Add <link> to point to a resource related to the RFC.

   o  Add <br> to allow line breaks (but not blank lines) in the
      generated output for table cells.

   o  Add <svg> to allow easy inclusion of SVG drawings in <artwork>.

1.3.2.  New Attributes for Existing Elements

   o  Add "sortRefs", "symRefs", "tocDepth", and "tocInclude" attributes
      to <rfc> to cover Processing Instructions (PIs) that were in v2
      that are still needed in the grammar.  Add "prepTime" to indicate
      the time that the XML went through a preparation step.  Add
      "version" to indicate the version of xml2rfc vocabulary used in
      the document.  Add "scripts" to indicate which scripts are needed
      to render the document.  Add "expiresDate" when an Internet-Draft
      expires.

   o  Add "ascii" attributes to <email>, <organization>, <street>,
      <city>, <region>, <country>, and <code>.  Also add
      "asciiFullname", "asciiInitials", and "asciiSurname" to <author>.
      This allows an author to specify their information in their native
      scripts as the primary entry and still allow the ASCII-equivalent
      values to appear in the processed documents.

   o  Add "anchor" attributes to many block elements to allow them to be
      linked with <relref> and <xref>.

   o  Add the "section", "relative", and "sectionFormat" attributes to
      <xref>.

   o  Add the "numbered" and "removeInRFC" attributes to <section>.

   o  Add the "removeInRFC" attribute to <note>.

   o  Add "pn" to <artwork>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <boilerplate>,<dt>,
      <figure>, <li>, <section> <sourcecode>, <t>, and <table> to hold
      automatically generated numbers for items in a section that don't
      have their own numbering (namely figures and tables).

   o  Add "display" to <cref> to indicate to tools whether or not to
      display the comment.

   o  Add "keepWithNext" and "keepWithPrevious" to <t> as a hint to
      tools that do pagination that they should try to keep the
      paragraph with the next/previous element.

1.3.3.  Elements and Attributes Deprecated from v2

   Deprecated elements and attributes are legacy vocabulary from v2 that
   are supported for input to v3 tools.  They are likely to be removed
   from those tools in the future.  Instead of being listed in
   Section 2, they are listed in Section 3.  See Appendix B for more
   information on tools and how they will handle deprecated features.

   o  Deprecate <list> in favor of <dl>, <ul>, and <ol>.

   o  Deprecate <spanx>; replace it with <strong>, <em>, and <tt>.

   o  Deprecate <vspace> because the major use for it, creating pseudo-
      paragraph-breaks in lists, is now handled properly.

   o  Deprecate <texttable>, <ttcol>, and <c>; replace them with the new
      table elements (<table> and the elements that can be contained
      within it).

   o  Deprecate <facsimile> because it is rarely used.

   o  Deprecate <format> because it is not useful and has caused
      surprise for authors in the past.  If the goal is to provide a
      single URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for a reference, use the
      "target" attribute on <reference> instead.

   o  Deprecate <preamble> and <postamble> in favor of simply using <t>
      before or after the figure.  This also deprecates the "align"
      attribute in <figure>.

   o  Deprecate the "title" attribute in <section>, <note>, <figure>,
      <references>, and <texttable> in favor of the new <name>.

   o  Deprecate the "alt", and "src" attributes in <figure> because they
      overlap with the attributes in <artwork>.

   o  Deprecate the "xml:space" attribute in <artwork> because there was
      only one useful value.  Deprecate "height" and "width" attribute
      in both <artwork> and <figure> because they are not needed for the
      new output formats.

   o  Deprecate the "pageno" attribute in <xref> because it was unused
      in v2.  Deprecate the "none" values for the "format" attribute in
      <xref> because it makes no sense semantically.

1.3.4.  Additional Changes from v2

   o  Allow non-ASCII characters in the format; the characters that are
      actually allowed will be determined by the RFC Series Editor.

   o  Allow <artwork> and <sourcecode> to be used on their own in
      <section> (no longer confine them to a figure).

   o  Give more specifics of handling the "type" attribute in <artwork>.

   o  Allow <strong>, <em>, <tt>, <eref>, and <xref> in <cref>.

   o  Allow the sub-elements inside a <reference> to be in any order.

   o  Turned off the autogeneration of anchors in <cref> because there
      is no use case for them that cannot be achieved in other ways.

   o  Allow more than one <artwork>, or more than one <sourcecode>, in
      <figure>.

   o  In <front>, make <date> optional.

   o  In <date>, added restrictions to the "date" and "year" attribute
      when used in the <front> for the document's boilerplate text.

   o  In <postal>, allow the sub-elements to be in any order.  Also
      allow the inclusion of the new <postalLine> instead of the older
      elements.

   o  In <section>, restricted the names of the anchors that can be used
      on some types of sections.

   o  Made <seriesInfo> a child of <front>, and deprecated it as a child
      of <reference>.  This also deprecates some of the attributes from
      <rfc> and moves them into <seriesInfo>.

   o  <t> now only contains non-block elements, so it no longer contains
      <figure> elements.

   o  Do not generate the grammar from a DTD, but instead get it
      directly from the Relax Next Generation (RNG) grammar [RNG].

1.4.  Syntax Notation

   The XML vocabulary here is defined in prose, based on the Relax NG
   schema ([RNC]) contained in Appendix C (specified in Relax NG Compact
   Notation, (RNC)).

   Note that the schema can be used for automated validity checks, but
   certain constraints are only described in prose (example: the
   conditionally required presence of the "abbrev" attribute).

2.  Elements

   The sections below describe all elements and their attributes.

   Note that attributes not labeled "mandatory" are optional.

   Many elements have an optional "anchor" attribute.  In all cases, the
   value of the "anchor" attribute needs to be a valid XML "Name"
   (Section 2.3 of [XML]), additionally constrained to US-ASCII
   characters ([USASCII]).  Thus, the character repertoire consists of
   "A-Z", "a-z", "0-9", "_", "-", ".", and ":", where "0-9", ".", and
   "-" are disallowed as start characters.  Anchors are described in
   more detail in Appendix B.2.

   Tools interpreting the XML described here will collapse horizontal
   whitespace and line breaks to a single whitespace (except inside
   <artwork> and <sourcecode>), and will trim leading and trailing
   whitespace.

   Some of the elements have attributes that are not described in this
   section because those attributes are specific to the prep tool.
   People writing tools to process this format should read all of the
   appendices for a complete description of these attributes.

   Every element in the v3 vocabulary can have an "xml:lang" attribute,
   an "xml:base" attribute, or both.  The xml:lang attribute specifies
   the language used in the element.  This is sometimes useful for
   renderers which display different fonts for ideographic characters
   used in China and Japan.  The xml:base attribute is sometimes added
   to an XML file when doing XML-to-XML conversion where the base file
   has XInclude atttributes (see Appendix B.1).

2.1.  <abstract>

   Contains the Abstract of the document.  See [RFC7322] for more
   information on restrictions for the Abstract.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model:

   In any order, but at least one of:

   o  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

   o  <ol> elements (Section 2.34)

   o  <t> elements (Section 2.53)

   o  <ul> elements (Section 2.63)

2.1.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for the Abstract.

2.2.  <address>

   Provides address information for the author.

   This element appears as a child element of <author> (Section 2.7).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <postal> element (Section 2.37)

   2.  One optional <phone> element (Section 2.36)

   3.  One optional <facsimile> element (Section 3.2)

   4.  One optional <email> element (Section 2.23)

   5.  One optional <uri> element (Section 2.64)

2.3.  <annotation>

   Provides additional prose augmenting a bibliographical reference.
   This text is intended to be shown after the rest of the generated
   reference text.

   This element appears as a child element of <reference>
   (Section 2.40).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <bcp14> elements (Section 2.9)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.24)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

   o  <relref> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <spanx> elements (Section 3.7)

   o  <strong> elements (Section 2.50)

   o  <sub> elements (Section 2.51)

   o  <sup> elements (Section 2.52)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)

2.4.  <area>

   Provides information about the IETF area to which this document
   relates (currently not used when generating documents).

   The value ought to be either the full name or the abbreviation of one
   of the IETF areas as listed on <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/area.html>.
   The list will be kept by the RFC Series Editor.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model: only text content.

2.5.  <artwork>

   This element allows the inclusion of "artwork" in the document.
   <artwork> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks; thus is used for a variety of things, such as diagrams ("line
   art") and protocol unit diagrams.

   Alternatively, the "src" attribute allows referencing an external
   graphics file, such as a vector drawing in SVG or a bitmap graphic
   file, using a URI.  In this case, the textual content acts as a
   fallback for output representations that do not support graphics;
   thus, it ought to contain either (1) a "line art" variant of the
   graphics or (2) prose that describes the included image in sufficient
   detail.

   If the artwork includes either "&" or "<" characters, or the string
   "]]>" those characters need to be encoded using escaping or CDATA
   block(s); see <sourcecode> for a fuller description of these
   solutions.

   In [RFC7749], the <artwork> element was also used for source code and
   formal languages; in v3, this is now done with <sourcecode>.

   There are at least five ways to include SVG in artwork in Internet-
   Drafts:

   o  Inline, by including all of the SVG in the content of the element,
      such as: <artwork type="svg"><svg xmlns...">

   o  Inline, but using XInclude (see Appendix B.1), such as: <artwork
      type="svg"><xi:include href=...>

   o  As a data: URI, such as: <artwork type="svg" src="data:image/
      svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3...">

   o  As a URI to an external entity, such as: <artwork type="svg"
      src="http://www.example.com/...">

   o  As a local file, such as: <artwork type="svg" src="diagram12.svg">

   The use of SVG in Internet-Drafts and RFCs is covered in much more
   detail in [SVGforRFCs].

   The above methods for inclusion of SVG art can also be used for
   including text artwork, but using a data: URI is probably confusing
   for text artwork.

   Formatters that do pagination should attempt to keep artwork on a
   single page.  This is to prevent artwork that is split across pages
   from looking like two separate pieces of artwork.

   This element appears as a child element of <aside> (Section 2.6),
   <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <dd> (Section 2.18), <figure>
   (Section 2.25), <li> (Section 2.29), <section> (Section 2.46), <td>
   (Section 2.56), and <th> (Section 2.58).

   Content model:

   Either:

      Text

   Or:

      <svg> elements (Section 4)

2.5.1.  "align" Attribute

   Controls whether the artwork appears left justified (default),
   centered, or right justified.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.5.2.  "alt" Attribute

   Alternative text description of the artwork (which is more than just
   a summary or caption).  When the art comes from the "src" attribute,
   and the format of that artwork supports alternate text, the
   alternative text comes from the text of the artwork itself, not from
   this attribute.  The contents of this attribute are important to
   readers who are visually impaired, as well as those reading on
   devices that cannot show the artwork well, or at all.

2.5.3.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this artwork.

2.5.4.  "height" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.5.  "name" Attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).  This attribute can be helpful for other kinds of tools
   (such as automated syntax checkers, which work by extracting the
   artwork).  Note that the "name" attribute does not need to be unique
   for artwork elements in a document.  If multiple artwork elements
   have the same name attribute, a processing tool might assume that the
   elements are all fragments of a single file, and the tool can collect
   those fragments for later processing.  See Section 6 for a discussion
   of possible problems with the value of this attribute.

2.5.6.  "src" Attribute

   The URI reference of a graphics file ([RFC3986]), or the name of a
   file on the local disk.  This can be a "data" URI [RFC2397] that
   contains the contents of the graphics file.  Note that the inclusion
   of art with the "src" attribute depends on the capabilities of the
   processing tool reading the XML document.  Tools need to be able to
   handle the file: URI, and should be able to handle http: and https:
   URIs as well.  The prep tool will be able to handle reading the "src"
   attribute.

   If no URI scheme is given in the attribute, the attribute is
   considered to be a local file name relative to the current directory.
   Processing tools must be careful to not accept dangerous values for
   the filename, particularly those that contain absolute references
   outside the current directory.  Document creators should think hard
   before using relative URIs due to possible later problems if files
   move around on the disk.  Also, documents should most likely use
   explicit URI schemes wherever possible.

   In some cases, the prep tool may remove the "src" attribute after
   processing its value.  See [PREPTOOL] for a description of this.

   It is an error to have both a "src" attribute and content in the
   <artwork> element.

2.5.7.  "type" Attribute

   Specifies the type of the artwork.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.

   The preferred values for <artwork> types are:

   o  ascii-art

   o  binary-art

   o  call-flow

   o  hex-dump

   o  svg

   The RFC Series Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred
   values on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over
   time.  Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type or no type is specified.

2.5.8.  "width" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.5.9.  "xml:space" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.6.  <aside>

   This element is a container for content that is semantically less
   important or tangential to the content that surrounds it.

   This element appears as a child element of <section> (Section 2.46).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  <artwork> elements (Section 2.5)

   o  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

   o  <figure> elements (Section 2.25)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

   o  <list> elements (Section 3.4)

   o  <ol> elements (Section 2.34)

   o  <t> elements (Section 2.53)

   o  <table> elements (Section 2.54)

   o  <ul> elements (Section 2.63)

2.6.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this aside.

2.7.  <author>

   Provides information about a document's author.  This is used both
   for the document itself (at the beginning of the document) and for
   referenced documents.

   The <author> elements contained within the document's <front> element
   are used to fill the boilerplate, and also to generate the "Author's
   Address" section (see [RFC7322]).

   Note that an "author" can also be just an organization (by not
   specifying any of the name attributes, but adding the <organization>
   child element).

   Furthermore, the "role" attribute can be used to mark an author as
   "editor".  This is reflected both on the front page and in the
   "Author's Address" section, as well as in bibliographical references.
   Note that this specification does not define a precise meaning for
   the term "editor".

   See Section "Authors vs. Contributors" of [RFC7322] for more
   information.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <organization> element (Section 2.35)

   2.  One optional <address> element (Section 2.2)

2.7.1.  "asciiFullname" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's full name.

2.7.2.  "asciiInitials" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's initials, to be used in
   conjunction with the separately specified asciiSurname.

2.7.3.  "asciiSurname" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's surname, to be used in
   conjunction with the separately specified asciiInitials.

2.7.4.  "fullname" Attribute

   The full name (used in the automatically generated "Author's Address"
   section).

2.7.5.  "initials" Attribute

   An abbreviated variant of the given name(s), to be used in
   conjunction with the separately specified surname.  It usually
   appears on the front page, in footers, and in references.

   Some processors will post-process the value, for instance when it
   only contains a single letter (in which case they might add a
   trailing dot).  Relying on this kind of post-processing can lead to
   results varying across formatters and thus ought to be avoided.

2.7.6.  "role" Attribute

   Specifies the role the author had in creating the document.

   Allowed values:

   o  "editor"

2.7.7.  "surname" Attribute

   The author's surname, to be used in conjunction with the separately
   specified initials.  It usually appears on the front page, in
   footers, and in references.

2.8.  <back>

   Contains the "back" part of the document: the references and
   appendices.  In <back>, <section> elements indicate appendices.

   This element appears as a child element of <rfc> (Section 2.45).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  Optional <displayreference> elements (Section 2.19)

   2.  Optional <references> elements (Section 2.42)

   3.  Optional <section> elements (Section 2.46)

2.9.  <bcp14>

   Marks text that are phrases defined in BCP 14 such as "MUST", "SHOULD
   NOT", and so on.  When shown in some of the output representations,
   the text in this element might be highlighted.  The use of this
   element is optional.

   This element is only to be used around the actual phrase from BCP 14,
   not the full definition of a requirement.  For example, it is correct
   to say "The packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be dropped.", but it is not
   correct to say "<bcp14>The packet MUST be dropped.</bcp14>".

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>

2.10.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this quotation.

2.10.2.  "cite" Attribute

   The source of the citation.  This must be a URI.  If the quotedFrom
   attribute is given, this URI will be used by processing tools as the
   link for the text of that attribute.

2.10.3.  "quotedFrom" Attribute

   Name of person or document the text in this element is quoted from.
   A formatter should render this as visible text at the end of the
   quotation.

2.11.  <boilerplate>

   Holds the boilerplate text for the document.  This section is filled
   in by the prep tool.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model:

   One or more <section> elements (Section 2.46)

2.12.  <br>

   Indicates that a line break should be inserted in the generated
   output by a formatting tool.  It is always expressed as <br />.
   Multiple successive instances of this element do not cause blank
   lines to appear in the output, and is thus not useful.

   This element appears as a child element of <td> (Section 2.56) and
   <th> (Section 2.58).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.13.  <city>

   Gives the city name in a postal address.

   This element appears as a child element of <postal> (Section 2.37).

   Content model: only text content.

2.13.1.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the city name.

2.14.  <code>

   The ASCII equivalent of the country name.

2.16.  <cref>

   Represents a comment.

   Comments can be used in a document while it is work in progress.
   They might appear either inline and visually highlighted, at the end
   of the document, or not at all, depending on the formatting tool.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)

2.16.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this comment.

2.16.2.  "display" Attribute

   Suggests whether or not the comment should be displayed by formatting
   tools.  This might be set to "false" if you want to keep a comment in
   a document after the contents of the comment have already been dealt
   with.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.16.3.  "source" Attribute

   Holds the "source" of a comment, such as the name or the initials of
   the person who made the comment.

2.17.  <date>

   Provides information about the publication date.  This element is
   used for two cases: the boilerplate of the document being produced,
   and inside bibliographic references that use the <front> element.

   Boilerplate for Internet-Drafts and RFCs:  This element defines the
      date of publication for the current document (Internet-Draft or
      RFC).  When producing Internet-Drafts, the prep tool uses this
      date to compute the expiration date (see [IDGUIDE]).  When one or
      more of "year", "month", or "day" are left out, the prep tool will
      attempt to use the current system date if the attributes that are
      present are consistent with that date.

      If given, the month must be a number.  Note that this restriction
      is different than that in that in [RFC7749].  The prep tool will
      silently change text month names to numbers.  The year must be a
      four-digit number.

      When the prep tool is used to create Internet-Drafts, it will
      reject a submitted Internet-Draft that has a <date> element in the
      boilerplate for itself that is anything other than today.  That
      is, the tool will not allow a submitter to specify a date other
      than the day of submission.  To avoid this problem, authors might
      simply not include a <date> element in the boilerplate.

   Bibliographic references:  The date information can have prose text
      for the month or year.  For example, vague dates (year="ca.
      2000"), date ranges (year="2012-2013"), non-specific months
      (month="Second quarter") and so on are allowed.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.17.1.  "day" Attribute

   The day of publication.

2.17.2.  "month" Attribute

   The month or months of publication.

2.17.3.  "year" Attribute

   The year or years of publication.

2.18.  <dd>

   The definition part of an entry in a definition list.

   This element appears as a child element of <dl> (Section 2.20).

   Content model:

   Either:

      In any order, but at least one of:


      *  <artwork> elements (Section 2.5)

      *  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

      *  <figure> elements (Section 2.25)

      *  <ol> elements (Section 2.34)

      *  <sourcecode> elements (Section 2.48)

      *  <t> elements (Section 2.53)

      *  <ul> elements (Section 2.63)


   Or:

      In any order, but at least one of:


      *  Text

      *  <bcp14> elements (Section 2.9)

      *  <cref> elements (Section 2.16)

      *  <em> elements (Section 2.22)

      *  <eref> elements (Section 2.24)

      *  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

      *  <relref> elements (Section 2.44)

      *  <strong> elements (Section 2.50)

      *  <sub> elements (Section 2.51)

      *  <sup> elements (Section 2.52)

      *  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

      *  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)


2.18.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this definition.

2.19.  <displayreference>

   This element gives a mapping between the anchor of a reference and a
   name that will be displayed instead.  This allows authors to display
   more mnemonic anchor names for automatically-included references.
   The mapping in this element only applies to <xref> elements whose
   format is "default".  For example, if the reference uses the anchor
   "RFC6949", the following would cause that anchor in the body of
   displayed documents to be "RFC-dev":

   <displayreference target="RFC6449" to="RFC-dev"/>

   If a reference section is sorted, this element changes the sort
   order.

   It is expected that this element will only be valid in input
   documents.  It will be likely be removed by prep tools when preparing
   a final version after those tools have replaced all of the associated
   anchors, targets, and derivedContent attributes.

   This element appears as a child element of <back> (Section 2.8).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.19.1.  "target" Attribute (Mandatory)

   This attribute must be the name of an anchor in a <reference> or
   <referencegroup> element.

2.19.2.  "to" Attribute (Mandatory)

   This attribute is a name that will be displayed as the anchor instead
   of the anchor that is given in the <reference> element.  The string
   given must start with one of the following characters: 0-9, a-z, A-Z.
   The other characters in the string must be 0-9, a-z, A-Z, "-", ".",
   and "_".

2.20.  <dl>

   A definition list.  Each entry has a pair of elements: a term (<dt>)
   and a definition (<dd>).  (This is slightly different and simpler
   than the model used in HTML, which allows for multiple terms for a
   single definition.)

   This element appears as a child element of <abstract> (Section 2.1),
   <aside> (Section 2.6), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <dd>
   (Section 2.18), <li> (Section 2.29), <note> (Section 2.33), <section>
   (Section 2.46), <td> (Section 2.56), and <th> (Section 2.58).

   Content model:

   One or more sequences of:

   1.  One <dt> element

   2.  One <dd> element

2.20.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for the list.

2.20.2.  "hanging" Attribute

   The hanging attribute defines whether or not the term appears on the
   same line as the definition. hanging="true" indicates that the term
   is to the left of the definition, while hanging="false" indicates
   that the term will be on a separate line.

   Allowed values:

   o  "false"

   o  "true" (default)

2.20.3.  "spacing" Attribute

   Defines whether or not there is a blank line between entries.
   spacing="normal" indicates a single blank line, while
   spacing="compact" indicates no space between.

   Allowed values:

   o  "normal" (default)

   o  "compact"

2.21.  <dt>

   The term being defined in a definition list.

   This element appears as a child element of <dl> (Section 2.20).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <bcp14> elements (Section 2.9)

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.24)

   o  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

   o  <relref> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <strong> elements (Section 2.50)

   o  <sub> elements (Section 2.51)

   o  <sup> elements (Section 2.52)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)

2.21.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this term.

2.22.  <em>

   Indicates text that is semantically emphasized.  This element will be
   displayed as italic after processing.  This element can be combined
   with other character formatting elements, and the formatting will be
   additive.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <cref> (Section 2.16),

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)

2.23.  <email>

   Provides an email address.

   The value is expected to be the addr-spec defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC6068].

   This element appears as a child element of <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.23.1.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the author's email address.  This is only
   used if the email address has any internationalized components.

2.24.  <eref>

   Represents an "external" link (as specified in the "target"
   attribute).  This is useful for embedding URIs in the body of a
   document.

   If the <eref> element has non-empty text content, formatters should
   use the content as the displayed text that is linked.  Otherwise the
   formatter should use the value of the "target" attribute as the
   displayed text.  Formatters will link the displayed text to the value
   of the "target" attribute in a manner appropriate for the output
   format.

   For example, with an input of:

         This is described at
         <eref target="http://www.example.com/reports/r12.html"/>.

   An HTML formatter might generate

         This is described at
         <a href="http://www.example.com/reports/r12.html">
         http://www.example.com/reports/r12.html</a>.

   With an input of:

         This is described
         <eref target="http://www.example.com/reports/r12.html">
         in this interesting report</eref>.

   An HTML formatter might generate

2.24.1.  "target" Attribute (Mandatory)

   URI of the link target ([RFC3986]).  This must begin with a scheme
   name (such as "https://") and thus not be relative to the URL of the
   current document.

2.25.  <figure>

   Contains a figure with a caption with the figure number.  If the

   use the "target" attribute on <reference> instead.

2.25.3.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this figure.

2.25.4.  "height" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.25.5.  "src" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.25.6.  "suppress-title" Attribute

   Deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.25.7.  "title" Attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.25.8.  "width" Attribute

   Deprecated.

2.26.  <front>

   Represents the "front matter": metadata (such as author information),
   the Abstract, and additional notes.

   A <front> element may have more than one <seriesInfo> elements.  A
   <seriesInfo> element determines the document number (for RFCs) or
   name (for Internet-Drafts).  Another <seriesInfo> element determines
   the "maturity level" (see Section 4 of [RFC2026]), using values of
   "std" for "Standards Track", "bcp" for "BCP", "info" for
   "Informational", "exp" for "Experimental", and "historic" for
   "Historic".  The "name" attributes of those multiple <seriesInfo>
   elements interact as described in the section on <seriesInfo>.

   This element appears as a child element of <reference> (Section 2.40)
   and <rfc> (Section 2.45).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.   One <title> element (Section 2.60)

   2.   One or more <author> elements (Section 2.7)

   3.   One optional <date> element (Section 2.17)

   4.   Optional <area> elements (Section 2.4)

   5.   Optional <workgroup> elements (Section 2.65)

   6.   Optional <keyword> elements (Section 2.28)

   7.   One optional <abstract> element (Section 2.1)

   8.   Optional <seriesInfo> elements (Section 2.47)

   9.   Optional <note> elements (Section 2.33)

   10.  One optional <boilerplate> element (Section 2.11)

2.27.  <iref>

   Provides terms for the document's index.

   Index entries can be either regular entries (when just the "item"
   attribute is given) or nested entries (by specifying "subitem" as
   well), grouped under a regular entry.

   Index entries generally refer to the exact place where the <iref>
   element occurred.  An exception is the occurrence as a child element
   of <section>, in which case the whole section is considered to be
   relevant for that index entry.  In some formats, index entries of
   this type might be displayed as ranges.

   When the prep tool is creating index content, it collects the items
   in a case-sensitive fashion for both the item and subitem level.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <aside> (Section 2.6), <blockquote> (Section 2.10),
   <c> (Section 3.1), <dd> (Section 2.18), <dt> (Section 2.21), <em>

   (Section 2.56), <th> (Section 2.58), <tt> (Section 2.62), and <ttcol>
   (Section 3.9).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.27.1.  "item" Attribute (Mandatory)

   The item to include.

2.27.2.  "primary" Attribute

   Setting this to "true" declares the occurrence as "primary", which
   might cause it to be highlighted in the index.  There is no
   restriction on the number of occurrences that can be "primary".

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.27.3.  "subitem" Attribute

   The subitem to include.

2.28.  <keyword>

   Specifies a keyword applicable to the document.

   Note that each element should only contain a single keyword; for
   multiple keywords, the element can simply be repeated.

   Keywords are used both in the RFC Index and in the metadata of
   generated document representations.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model: only text content.

2.29.  <li>

   A list element, used in <ol> and <ul>.

   This element appears as a child element of <ol> (Section 2.34) and
   <ul> (Section 2.63).

   Content model:

   Either:

      In any order, but at least one of:


      *  <artwork> elements (Section 2.5)

      *  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

      *  <sup> elements (Section 2.52)

      *  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

      *  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)


2.29.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this list item.

2.30.  <link>

   A link to an external document that is related to the RFC.

   The following are the supported types of external documents that can
   be pointed to in a <link> element:

   o  The current ISSN for the RFC series.  The value for the "rel"
      attribute is "item".  The link should use the form "urn:issn:".

   o  The DOI for this document.  The value for the "rel" attribute is
      "describedBy".  The link should use the form specified in
      [RFC7669].

   o  The Internet-Draft that was submitted to the RFC Editor to become
      the published RFC.  The value for the "rel" attribute is
      "convertedFrom".  The link should be to an IETF-controlled web
      site that retains copies of Internet-Drafts.

   o  A representation of the document offered by the document author.
      The value for the "rel" attribute is "alternate".  The link can be
      to a personally-run web site.

   In RFC production mode, the prep tool needs to check the values for
   <link> before an RFC is published.  In draft production mode, the
   prep tool might remove some <link> elements during the draft
   submission process.

   This element appears as a child element of <rfc> (Section 2.45).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.30.1.  "href" Attribute (Mandatory)

   The URI of the external document.

2.30.2.  "rel" Attribute

   The relationship of the external document to this one.  The
   relationships are taken from Link Relations registry maintained by
   IANA [LINKRELATIONS].

2.31.  <middle>

   Represents the main content of the document.

   This element appears as a child element of <rfc> (Section 2.45).

   Content model:

   One or more <section> elements (Section 2.46)

2.32.  <name>

   The name of the section, note, figure, or texttable.  This name can
   have flow markup such as to make some characters use a fixed-width
   font, or to include references.

   This element appears as a child element of <figure> (Section 2.25),
   <note> (Section 2.33), <references> (Section 2.42), <section>
   (Section 2.46), <table> (Section 2.54), and <texttable>
   (Section 3.8).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <cref> elements (Section 2.16)

   o  <eref> elements (Section 2.24)

   o  <relref> elements (Section 2.44)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

   o  <xref> elements (Section 2.66)

2.33.  <note>

   Creates an unnumbered section that appears after the Abstract.

   It is usually used for additional information to reviewers (working
   group information, mailing list, ...), or for additional publication
   information such as "IESG Notes".

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <name> element (Section 2.32)

   2.  In any order, but at least one of:


       *  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

       *  <ol> elements (Section 2.34)

       *  <t> elements (Section 2.53)

       *  <ul> elements (Section 2.63)


2.33.1.  "removeInRFC" Attribute

   If set to "true", this note is marked in the prep tool with text
   indicating that it should be removed before the document is published
   as an RFC.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.33.2.  "title" Attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.34.  <ol>

   An ordered list.  The labels on the items will be either a number or
   a letter, depending on the value of the style attribute.

   This element appears as a child element of <abstract> (Section 2.1),
   <aside> (Section 2.6), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <dd>
   (Section 2.18), <li> (Section 2.29), <note> (Section 2.33), <section>
   (Section 2.46), <td> (Section 2.56), and <th> (Section 2.58).

   Content model:

   One or more <li> elements (Section 2.29)

2.34.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for the list.

2.34.2.  "group" Attribute

   When the prep tool sees an <ol> element with a "group" attribute that
   has already been seen, it continues the numbering of the list from
   where the previous list with the same group name left off.  If an
   <ol> element has both a "group" and "start" attribute, the group's
   numbering is reset to the given start value.

2.34.3.  "spacing" Attribute

   Defines whether or not there is a blank line between entries.
   spacing="normal" indicates a single blank line, while
   spacing="compact" indicates no space between.

   Allowed values:

   o  "normal" (default)

   o  "compact"

2.34.4.  "start" Attribute

   The ordinal value to start the list at.  This defaults to "1", and
   must be an integer of 0 or greater.

2.34.5.  "type" Attribute

   The type of the labels on list items.  If the length of the type
   value is 1, the meaning is the same as it is for HTML:

   a  Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   A  Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   1  Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   i  Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   I  Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   For type "a" and "A", after the 26th entry, the numbering starts at
   "aa"/"AA", then "ab"/"AB", and so on.

   If the length of the type value is greater than 1, the value must
   contain a percent-encoded indicator and other text.  The value is a
   free-form text that allows counter values to be inserted using a
   "percent-letter" format.  For instance, "[REQ%d]" generates labels of
   the form "[REQ1]", where "%d" inserts the item number as a decimal
   number.

   The following formats are supported:

   %c Lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...)

   %C Uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)

   %d Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

   %i Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)

   %I Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)

   %% Represents a percent sign

   Other formats are reserved for future use.  Only one percent encoding
   other than "%%" is allowed in a type string.

   It is an error for the type string to be empty.  For bulleted lists,
   use the <ul> element.  For lists that have neither bullets nor
   numbers, use the <ul> element with the 'empty="true"' attribute.

   If no type attribute is given, the default type is the same as
   "type='%d.'".

2.35.  <organization>

   Specifies the affiliation ([RFC7322]) of an author.

   This information appears both in the "Author's Address" section and
   on the front page (see [RFC7322] for more information).  If the value
   is long, an abbreviated variant can be specified in the "abbrev"
   attribute.

   This element appears as a child element of <author> (Section 2.7).

   Content model: only text content.

2.35.1.  "abbrev" Attribute

   Abbreviated variant.

2.35.2.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the organization's name.

2.36.  <phone>

   Represents a phone number.

   The value is expected to be the scheme-specific part of a "tel" URI
   (so does not include the prefix "tel:"), using the "global-number-
   digits" syntax.  See Section 3 of [RFC3966] for details.

   This element appears as a child element of <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.37.  <postal>

   Contains optional child elements providing postal information.  These
   elements will be displayed in an order that is specific to
   formatters.  A postal address can contain only a set of <street>,
   <city>, <region>, <code>, and <country> elements, or only an ordered
   set of <postalLine> elements, but not both.

   This element appears as a child element of <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model:

   Either:

      In any order:


      *  <city> elements (Section 2.13)

      *  <code> elements (Section 2.14)

      *  <country> elements (Section 2.15)

      *  <region> elements (Section 2.43)

      *  <street> elements (Section 2.49)


   Or:

      One or more <postalLine> elements (Section 2.38)

2.38.  <postalLine>

   Represents one line of a postal address.  When more than one
   <postalLine> is given, the prep tool emits them in the order given.

   This element appears as a child element of <postal> (Section 2.37).

   Content model: only text content.

2.38.1.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the text in the address line.

2.39.  <refcontent>

   Text that should appear between the title and the date of a
   reference.  The purpose of this element is to prevent the need to
   abuse <seriesInfo> to get such text in a reference.

   For example:

   <reference anchor="April1">
     <front>
       <title>On Being A Fool</title>
       <author initials="K." surname="Phunny" fullname="Knot Phunny"/>
       <date year="2000" month="April"/>
     </front>
     <refcontent>Self-published pamphlet</refcontent>
   </reference>

   would render as:

      [April1]     Phunny, K., "On Being A Fool", Self-published
                   pamphlet, April 2000.

   This element appears as a child element of <reference>
   (Section 2.40).

   Content model:

   In any order:

   o  Text

   o  <bcp14> elements (Section 2.9)

   o  <em> elements (Section 2.22)

   o  <strong> elements (Section 2.50)

   o  <sub> elements (Section 2.51)

   o  <sup> elements (Section 2.52)

   o  <tt> elements (Section 2.62)

2.40.  <reference>

   Represents a bibliographical reference.

   This element appears as a child element of <referencegroup>
   (Section 2.41) and <references> (Section 2.42).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One <front> element (Section 2.26)

   2.  In any order:


       *  <annotation> elements (Section 2.3)

       *  <format> elements (Section 3.3)

       *  <refcontent> elements (Section 2.39)

       *  <seriesInfo> elements (Section 2.47; deprecated in this
          context)


2.40.1.  "anchor" Attribute (Mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference.  Usually, this
   will be used both to "label" the reference in the "References"
   section, and as an identifier in links to this reference entry.

2.40.2.  "quoteTitle" Attribute

   Specifies whether or not the title in the reference should be quoted.
   This can be used to prevent quoting, such as on errata.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.40.3.  "target" Attribute

   Holds the URI for the reference.

2.41.  <referencegroup>

   Represents a list of bibliographic references that will be
   represented as a single reference.  This is most often used for
   references in the STD and BCP series, where a single reference (such
   as "BCP 9") encompasses more than one RFC.

   This element appears as a child element of <references>
   (Section 2.42).

   Content model:

   One or more <reference> elements (Section 2.40)

2.41.1.  "anchor" Attribute (Mandatory)

   Document-wide unique identifier for this reference group.  Usually,
   this will be used both to "label" the reference group in the
   "References" section, and as an identifier in links to this reference
   entry.

2.42.  <references>

   Contains a set of bibliographical references.

   In the early days of the RFC series, there was only one "References"
   section per RFC.  This convention was later changed to group
   references into two sets, "Normative" and "Informative", as described
   in [RFC7322]).  This vocabulary supports the split with the <name>
   child element.  In general, the title should be either "Normative
   References" or "Informative References".

   By default, the order of references is significant.  Some formatters,
   however, might be able to be requested to sort them based on their
   anchor names.

   This element appears as a child element of <back> (Section 2.8).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <name> element (Section 2.32)

   2.  In any order:


       *  <reference> elements (Section 2.40)

       *  <referencegroup> elements (Section 2.41)


2.42.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   An optional user-supplied for this section.

2.42.2.  "title" Attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.43.  <region>

   Provides the region name in a postal address.

   This element appears as a child element of <postal> (Section 2.37).

   Content model: only text content.

2.43.1.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the region name.

2.44.  <relref>

   A relative link to a reference from the "References" section.
   Formatters that have links (such as HTML and PDF) are likely to
   render <relref> elements as external hyperlinks to the specified part
   of the reference, creating the link target by combining the base URI
   from the <reference> element with the "relative" attribute from this
   element.  The "target" attribute is required, and it must be the
   anchor of a <reference> element.

   Either the "relative" or the "section" attribute must be present, but
   both cannot be given for a <relref> element.  If a reference is an
   RFC or Internet-Draft that is in the v3 format and the desired
   relative reference is to a section of that reference, the "section"
   attribute is easier to use than the "relative" attribute because the
   value of "section" is just a section string such as "2.3".

   An example of the <relref> element with text content might be:

         See <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878">
         the protocol overview</relref>
         for more information.

   An HTML formatter might generate:

         See
         <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3">
         the protocol overview</a>
         for more information.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <cref> (Section 2.16),
   <dd> (Section 2.18), <dt> (Section 2.21), <em> (Section 2.22), <li>
   (Section 2.29), <name> (Section 2.32), <preamble> (Section 3.6),
   <strong> (Section 2.50), <sub> (Section 2.51), <sup> (Section 2.52),
   <t> (Section 2.53), <td> (Section 2.56), <th> (Section 2.58), and
   <tt> (Section 2.62).

   Content model: only text content.

2.44.1.  "displayFormat" Attribute

   This attribute is used to signal formatters what the desired format
   of the relative reference should be.  Formatters for document types
   that have linking capability should wrap each part of the displayed
   text in hyperlinks.  If there is content in the <relref> element,
   formatters will ignore the value of this attribute.

   "of"

      A formatter should display the relative reference as the contents
      of the "derivedRemoteContent" attribute followed by a space, the
      word "of", another space, and the value from the "target"
      attribute enclosed in square brackets.

      For example, if Section 2.3 of RFC 7878 has the title "Protocol
      Overview", with an input of:

         See
         <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="of"/>
         for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate:

         See
         <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3">
         Section 2.3</a> of
         [<a href="#RFC7878">RFC7878</a>]
         for an overview.

      Note that "displayFormat='of'" is the default for <relref> so it
      does not need to be given in a <relref> element if that format is
      desired.

   "comma"

      A formatter should display the relative reference as the value
      from the "target" attribute enclosed in square brackets, a comma,
      a space, and the "derivedRemoteContent" attribute.

      For example, if Section 2.3 of RFC 7878 has the title "Protocol
      Overview", with an input of:

         See
         <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="comma"/>,
         for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate:

         See
         [<a href="#RFC7878">RFC7878</a>],
         <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3">
         Section 2.3</a>, for an overview.

   "parens"

      A formatter should display the relative reference as the value
      from the "target" attribute enclosed in square brackets, a space,
      a left parenthesis, the "derivedRemoteContent" attribute, and a
      right parenthesis.

      For example, if Section 2.3 of RFC 7878 has the title "Protocol
      Overview", with an input of:

         See
         <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="parens"/>
         for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate

         See
         [<a href="#RFC7878">RFC7878</a>]
         (<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3">
         Section 2.3</a>)
         for an overview.

   "bare"

      A formatter should display the relative reference as the contents
      of the "derivedRemoteContent" attribute and nothing else.  This is
      useful when there are multiple relative references to a single
      base reference.

      For example:

         See
         <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="bare"/>
         and
         <relref section="2.4" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="of"/>
         for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate:

         <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3">
         Section 2.3</a>
         and
         <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.4">
         Section 2.4</a> of
         [<a href="#RFC7878">RFC7878</a>]
         for an overview.

   Allowed values:

   o  "of" (default)

   o  "comma"

   o  "parens"

   o  "bare"

2.44.2.  "relative" Attribute

   Specifies a relative reference from the URI in the target reference.
   This value must include whatever leading character is needed to
   create the relative reference; typically, this is "#" for HTML
   documents.

2.44.3.  "section" Attribute

   Specifies a section of the target reference.  If the reference is not
   an RFC or Internet-Draft, it is an error.

2.44.4.  "target" Attribute (Mandatory)

   The anchor of the reference for this element.  If this value is not
   an anchor to a <reference> or <referencegroup> element, it is an
   error.  If the reference at the target has no URI, it is an error.

2.45.  <rfc>

   This is the root element of the xml2rfc vocabulary.

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  Optional <link> elements (Section 2.30)

   2.  One <front> element (Section 2.26)

   3.  One <middle> element (Section 2.31)

   4.  One optional <back> element (Section 2.8)

2.45.1.  "category" Attribute

   Deprecated; instead, use the "name" attribute in <seriesInfo>.

2.45.2.  "consensus" Attribute

   Affects the generated boilerplate.  Note that the values of "no" and
   "yes" are deprecated and are replaced by "false" (the default) and
   "true".

   See [RFC5741] for more information.

   Allowed values:

   o  "no"

   o  "yes"

   o  "false" (default)

   o  "true"

2.45.3.  "docName" Attribute

   Deprecated; instead, use the "value" attribute in <seriesInfo>.

2.45.4.  "indexInclude" Attribute

   Specifies whether or not a formatter is requested to include an index
   in generated files.  If the source file has no <iref> elements, an
   index is never generated.  This option is useful for generating
   documents where the source document has <iref> elements but the
   author no longer wants an index.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.45.5.  "ipr" Attribute

   Represents the Intellectual Property status of the document.  See
   Appendix A.1 for details.

2.45.6.  "iprExtract" Attribute

   Identifies a single section within the document for which extraction
   "as is" is explicitly allowed (only relevant for historic values of
   the "ipr" attribute).

2.45.7.  "number" Attribute

   Deprecated; instead, use the "value" attribute in <seriesInfo>.

2.45.8.  "obsoletes" Attribute

   A comma-separated list of RFC numbers or Internet-Draft names.

   The prep tool will parse the attribute value so that incorrect
   references can be detected.

2.45.9.  "prepTime" Attribute

   The date that the XML was processed by a prep tool.  This is included
   in the XML file just before it is saved to disk.  The value is
   formatted using the format from [RFC3339].

2.45.10.  "seriesNo" Attribute

   Deprecated; instead, use the "value" attribute in <seriesInfo>.

2.45.11.  "sortRefs" Attribute

   Specifies whether or not the prep tool will sort the references in
   each reference section.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.45.12.  "submissionType" Attribute

   The document stream.

   See Section 2 of [RFC5741] for details.

   Allowed values:

   o  "IETF" (default)

   o  "IAB"

   o  "IRTF"

   o  "independent"

2.45.13.  "symRefs" Attribute

   Specifies whether or not a formatter is requested to use symbolic
   references (such as "[RFC2119]").  If the value for this is "false",
   the references come out as numbers (such as "[3]").

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.45.14.  "tocDepth" Attribute

   Specifies number of levels of heading that formatter is requested to
   include in the table of contents; the default is "3".

2.45.15.  "tocInclude" Attribute

   Specifies whether or not a formatter is requested to include a table
   of contents in generated files.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.45.16.  "updates" Attribute

   A comma-separated list of RFC numbers or Internet-Draft names.

   The prep tool will parse the attribute value so that incorrect
   references can be detected.

2.45.17.  "version" Attribute

   Specifies the version of xml2rfc syntax used in this document.  The
   only expected value (for now) is "3".

2.46.  <section>

   Represents a section (when inside a <middle> element) or an appendix
   (when inside a <back> element).

   Subsections are created by nesting <section> elements inside
   <section> elements.  Sections are allowed to be empty.

   This element appears as a child element of <back> (Section 2.8),
   <boilerplate> (Section 2.11), <middle> (Section 2.31), and <section>
   (Section 2.46).

   Content model:

   In this order:

   1.  One optional <name> element (Section 2.32)

   2.  In any order:


       *  <artwork> elements (Section 2.5)

       *  <aside> elements (Section 2.6)

       *  <blockquote> elements (Section 2.10)

       *  <dl> elements (Section 2.20)

       *  <figure> elements (Section 2.25)

       *  <iref> elements (Section 2.27)

       *  <ol> elements (Section 2.34)

       *  <sourcecode> elements (Section 2.48)

       *  <t> elements (Section 2.53)

       *  <table> elements (Section 2.54)

       *  <texttable> elements (Section 3.8)

       *  <ul> elements (Section 2.63)


   3.  Optional <section> elements (Section 2.46)

2.46.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this section.

2.46.2.  "numbered" Attribute

   If set to "false", the formatter is requested to not display a
   section number.  The prep tool will verify that such a section is not
   followed by a numbered section in a part, and will verify that the
   section is a top-level section.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true" (default)

   o  "false"

2.46.3.  "removeInRFC" Attribute

   If set to "true", the formatter is requested to mark this section
   with a paragraph at the beginning of the section indicating that it
   should be removed before the document is published as an RFC.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.46.4.  "title" Attribute

   Deprecated.  Use <name> instead.

2.46.5.  "toc" Attribute

   Indicates to a formatter whether or not the section is to be included
   in a table of contents, if such a table of contents is produced.
   This only takes effect if the level of the section would have
   appeared in the table of contents based on the "tocDepth" attribute
   of the <rfc> element, and of course only if the table of contents is
   being created based on the "tocInclude" attribute of the <rfc>
   element.  If this is set to "exclude", any section below this one
   will be excluded as well.  The "default" value indicates to include
   the section if it would be included by the tocDepth attribute of the
   <rfc> element.

   Allowed values:

   o  "include"

   o  "exclude"

   o  "default" (default)

2.47.  <seriesInfo>

   Specifies the document series in which this document appears, and
   also specifies an identifier within that series.

   A processing tool determines if it is working on an RFC or an
   Internet-Draft by inspecting the "name" attribute of a <seriesInfo>
   element inside the <front> element inside the <rfc> element, looking
   for "rfc" or "Internet-Draft".  (Specifying neither value in any of
   the <seriesInfo> elements can be useful for producing other types of
   documents, but is out of scope for this specification.)

   It is invalid to have multiple <seriesInfo> elements inside the same
   <front> element containing the same "name" value.  Some combinations
   of <seriesInfo> name attribute values make no sense, such as having
   both <seriesInfo name="rfc"/> and <seriesInfo name="Internet-Draft"/>
   in the same <front> element.

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26) and
   <reference> (Section 2.40; deprecated in this context).

   Content model: this element does not have any contents.

2.47.1.  "asciiName" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the name field.

2.47.2.  "asciiValue" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the value field.

2.47.3.  "name" Attribute (Mandatory)

   The name of the series.  The currently-known values are "RFC",
   "Internet-Draft" and "DOI".  The RFC Series Editor may change this
   list in the future.

   Some of the values for "name" interact as follows:

   o  If a <front> element contains a <seriesInfo> element with a name
      of "Internet-Draft", it can also have at most one additional
      <seriesInfo> element with a "status" attribute whose value is of
      "standard", "full-standard", "bcp", "fyi", "informational",
      "experimental", or "historic" to indicate the intended status of
      this Internet-Draft, if it were to be later published as an RFC.
      If such an additional <seriesInfo> element has one of those
      statuses, the name MUST be "".

   o  If a <front> element contains a <seriesInfo> element with a name
      of "RFC", it can also have at most one additional <seriesInfo>
      element with a "status" attribute whose value is of "full-
      standard", "bcp", or "fyi" to indicate the current status of this
      RFC.  If such an additional <seriesInfo> element has one of those
      statuses, the value attribute for that name MUST be the number
      within that series.  That <front> element might also contain an
      additional <seriesInfo> with the status of "info, "exp", or
      "historic" and a name of "" to indicate the status of the RFC.

   o  A <front> element that has a <seriesInfo> element that has the
      name "Internet-Draft" MUST NOT also have a <seriesInfo> element
      that has the name "RFC".

   o  The <seriesInfo> can contain the DOI for the referenced document.
      This MUST NOT be used when <seriesInfo> element is an eventual
      child element of a <rfc> element, only as an enventual child of a
      <reference> element.  The value attribute should use the form
      specified in [RFC7669].

2.47.4.  "status" Attribute

   The status of this document.  The currently-known values are
   "standard", "informational", "experimental", "bcp", "fyi", and "full-
   standard".  The RFC Series Editor may change this list in the future.

2.47.5.  "stream" Attribute

   The stream that originated of this document.  The currently-known
   values are "iesg", "iab", "ise", and "irtf".  The RFC Series Editor
   may change this list in the future.

2.47.6.  "value" Attribute (Mandatory)

   The identifier within the series specified by the "name" attribute.

   For BCPs, FYIs, RFCs, and STDs, this is the number within the series.
   For Internet-Drafts, it is the full draft name (ending with the two-
   digit version number).  For DOIs, the value is given such as
   "10.123456/rfc1149", (the actual value will be specified later in
   [RFC7669]).

   The name in the value should be the document name without any file
   extension.  For Internet-Drafts, the value for this attribute should
   be "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07", not
   "draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07.txt".

2.48.  <sourcecode>

   This element allows the inclusion of sourcecode into the document.

   <sourcecode> provides full control of horizontal whitespace and line
   breaks.  It is thus useful for source code and formal languages (such
   as ABNF [RFC5234] or the RNC notation used in this document).  When
   rendered, sourcecode is always shown in a monospace font.

   For artwork such as character-based art, diagrams of message layouts,
   and so on, use the <artwork> element instead.

   A common problem authors have with <sourcecode> is that the XML
   processor returns errors if the text in the artwork contains either
   the "&" or "<" character, or the string "]]>".  To avoid these
   problems, the "&" and "<" characters may be escaped using the strings
   "&amp;" and "&lt;", respectively; the "]]>" string can be represented
   as "]]&gt;".  Alternatively, they may be surrounded in a CDATA
   structure: "<![CDATA[]]>".  For example:

   Desired output:
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"

   Using escaping:
   <sourcecode>
      allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&amp;" | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | "|"
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA:
   <sourcecode>
   <![CDATA[   allowed-chars = "." | "," | "&" | "<" | ">" | "|"]]>
   </sourcecode>

   Using CDATA is not a panacea, but it does help prevent having to use
   escapes in places where using using escapes can cause other problems,
   such as difficulty of inclusion from other documents.

   Output formatters that do pagination should attempt to keep source
   code on a single page.  This is to prevent source code that is split
   across pages from looking like two separate pieces of code.

   This element appears as a child element of <blockquote>
   (Section 2.10), <dd> (Section 2.18), <figure> (Section 2.25), <li>
   (Section 2.29), <section> (Section 2.46), <td> (Section 2.56), and
   <th> (Section 2.58).

   Content model: only text content.

2.48.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this sourcecode.

2.48.2.  "name" Attribute

   A filename suitable for the contents (such as for extraction to a
   local file).  This attribute can be helpful for other kinds of tools
   (such as automated syntax checkers which work by extracting the
   source code).  Note that the "name" attribute does not need to be
   unique for artwork elements in a document.  If multiple sourcecode
   elements have the same name attribute, a formatter might assume that
   the elements are all fragments of a single file, and such a formatter
   can collect those fragments for later processing.

2.48.3.  "src" Attribute

   The URI reference of a source file ([RFC3986]).

   It is an error to have both a "src" attribute and content in the
   <sourcecode> element.

2.48.4.  "type" Attribute

   Specifies the type of the sourcecode.  The value of this attribute is
   free text with certain values designated as preferred.

   The preferred values for <sourcecode> types are:

   o  abnf

   o  asn.1

   o  bash

   o  c++

   o  c

   o  cbor

   o  dtd

   o  java

   o  javascript

   o  json

   o  mib

   o  perl

   o  pseudocode

   o  python

   o  rnc

   o  xml

   o  yang

   The RFC Series Editor will maintain a complete list of the preferred
   values on its web site, and that list is expected to be updated over
   time.  Thus, a consumer of v3 XML should not cause a failure when it
   encounters an unexpected type or no type is specified.

2.49.  <street>

   Provides a street address.

   This element appears as a child element of <postal> (Section 2.37).

   Content model: only text content.

2.49.1.  "ascii" Attribute

   The ASCII equivalent of the street address.

2.50.  <strong>

   Indicates text that is semantically strong.  This element will be
   displayed as bold after processing.  This element can be combined
   with other character formatting elements, and the formatting will be
   additive.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <cref> (Section 2.16),
   <dd> (Section 2.18), <dt> (Section 2.21), <em> (Section 2.22), <li>

2.53.1.  "anchor" Attribute

   Document-wide unique identifier for this paragraph.

2.53.2.  "hangText" Attribute

   Deprecated.  Instead use <dd> inside of a definition list (<dl>).

2.53.3.  "keepWithNext" Attribute

   Acts as a hint to the output formatters that do pagination to do a
   best effort attempt to keep the paragraph with the next element,
   whatever that happens to be.  For example, the HTML output @media
   print CSS might translate this to page-break-after: avoid.  For PDF,
   the paginator could attempt to keep the paragraph with the next
   element.  Note: this attribute is strictly a hint and not always
   actionable.

   Allowed values:

   o  "false" (default)

   o  "true"

2.53.4.  "keepWithPrevious" Attribute

   Acts as a hint to the output formatters that do pagination to do a
   best effort attempt to keep the paragraph with the previous element,
   whatever that happens to be.  For example, the HTML output @media
   print CSS might translate this to page-break-before: avoid.  For PDF,
   the paginator could attempt to keep the paragraph with the previous
   element.  Note: this attribute is strictly a hint and not always
   actionable.

   Allowed values:

   o  "false" (default)

   o  "true"

2.54.  <table>

   Contains a table with a caption with the table number.  If the
   element contains a <name> element, the caption will also show that
   name.

   Inside the <table> element is optionally a <thead> element to contain
   the rows that will be the table's heading and optionally a <tfoot>
   element to contain the rows of the table's footer.  If the XML is
   converted to a representation that has page breaks (such as PDFs, or
   printed HTML), the header and footer are meant to appear on each
   page.

   This element appears as a child element of <aside> (Section 2.6) and
   <section> (Section 2.46).

2.56.1.  "align" Attribute

   Controls whether the content of the cell appears left justified
   (default), centered, or right justified.  Note that "center" or
   "right" probably only work well in cells with plain text; any other
   elements might make the contents render badly.

   Allowed values:

   o  "left" (default)

   o  "center"

   o  "right"

2.56.2.  "anchor" Attribute

2.64.  <uri>

   Contains a web address associated with the author.

   The contents should be a valid URI; this most likely will be an
   "http:" or "https:" URI.

   This element appears as a child element of <address> (Section 2.2).

   Content model: only text content.

2.65.  <workgroup>

   This element is used to specify the Working Group (IETF) or Research
   Group (IRTF) from which the document originates, if any.  The
   recommended format is the official name of the Working Group (with
   some capitalization).

   In Internet-Drafts, this is used in the upper left corner of the
   boilerplate, replacing the "Network Working Group" string.
   Formatting software can append the words "Working Group" or "Research
   Group", depending on the "submissionType" property of the <rfc>
   element (Section 2.45.12).

   This element appears as a child element of <front> (Section 2.26).

   Content model: only text content.

2.66.  <xref>

   A reference to an anchor in this document.  Formatters that have
   links (such as HTML and PDF) are likely to render <xref> elements as
   internal hyperlinks.  This element is useful for referring to
   references in the "References" section, to specific sections of this
   document, to specific figures, and so on.  The "target" attribute is
   required.

   This element appears as a child element of <annotation>
   (Section 2.3), <blockquote> (Section 2.10), <c> (Section 3.1), <cref>
   (Section 2.16), <dd> (Section 2.18), <dt> (Section 2.21), <em>
   (Section 2.22), <li> (Section 2.29), <name> (Section 2.32),
   <postamble> (Section 3.5), <preamble> (Section 3.6), <strong>
   (Section 2.50), <sub> (Section 2.51), <sup> (Section 2.52), <t>
   (Section 2.53), <td> (Section 2.56), <th> (Section 2.58), <tt>
   (Section 2.62), and <ttcol> (Section 3.9).

   Content model: only text content.

2.66.1.  "format" Attribute

   This attribute signals to formatters what the desired format of the
   reference should be.  Formatters for document types that have linking
   capability should wrap the displayed text in hyperlinks.

   "counter"

      The "derivedContent" attribute will contain just a counter.  This
      is used for targets that are <section>, <figure>, <table>, or item
      in an ordered list.  Using "format='counter'" where the target is
      any other type of element is an error.

      For example, with an input of:

         <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
         . . .
         See Section <xref target="overview" format="counter"/>
         for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate "See Section <a href="#
      overview">1.7</a> for an overview.".

   "default"

      The "derivedContent" attribute will contain a text fragment that
      describes the referenced part completely, such as "XML" for a
      target that is a <reference>, or "Section 2" or "Table 4" for a
      target to a non-reference.

      For example, with an input of:

         <section anchor="overview">Protocol Overview</section>
         . . .
         See <xref target="overview"/> for an overview.

      An HTML formatter might generate "See <a href="#overview">Section
      1.7</a> for an overview.".

   "none"

      Deprecated.

   "title"

      If the target is a <reference> element, the "derivedContent"
      attribute will contain the name of the reference, extracted from
      the <title> child of the <front> child of the reference.  Or, if
      the target element has a <name> child element, the
      "derivedContent" attribute will contain the text content of that
      <name> element concatenated with the text content of each
      descendant node of <name> (that is, stripping out all of the XML
      markup, leaving only the text).  Or, if the target element does
      not contain a <name> child element, the "derivedContent" attribute
      will contain the name of the "anchor" attribute of that element
      with no other adornment.

   Allowed values:

   o  "default" (default)

   o  "title"

   o  "counter"

   o  "none"

2.66.2.  "pageno" Attribute

   Deprecated.

   Allowed values:

   o  "true"

   o  "false" (default)

2.66.3.  "target" Attribute (Mandatory)

   Identifies the document component being referenced.  The value needs
   to match the value of the "anchor" attribute of an element in the
   document, otherwise it is an error.

4.  SVG

   [[anchor7: Discuss relation to SVG draft.]]

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   This format is based on [XML] and thus does not have any issues
   representing arbitrary Unicode [UNICODE] characters in text content.
   The RFC Series Editor may restrict some of the characters that can be
   used in a particular RFC; the rules for such restrictions are covered
   in [NONASCII].

6.  Security Considerations

   The "name" attribute of the <artwork> element (Section 2.5.5) can be
   used to derive a filename for saving to a local file system.
   Trusting this kind of information without pre-processing is a known
   security risk; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6266] for more information.

   The "src" attribute on the <artwork> element can be used to read
   files from the local system.  Processing tools must be careful to not
   accept dangerous values for the filename, particularly those that
   contain absolute references outside the current directory.

   The "type" attribute of the <artwork> and <sourcecode> elements is
   meant to encourage formatters to automatically extract known types of
   content from an RFC or Internet-Draft.  While extraction is probably
   safe, those tools might also think that they could further process
   the extracted content such as by rendering artwork or executing code.
   Doing so without first sanity-checking the extracted content is
   clearly a terrible idea from a security perspective.  More generally,
   a tool that is reading XML input needs to be suspicious of any
   content that it intends to post-process.

   When there is an external reference to a URL, a processor or renderer
   should fetch the content into a sandbox, and should have only a
   localized impact on the document processing and rendering.

   All security considerations related to XML processing are relevant as
   well (see Section 7 of [RFC3470]).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Internet Media Type Registration

   IANA maintains the registry of Internet Media Types [BCP13] at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

   This document updates the specification for the Internet Media Type
   "application/rfc+xml" from the one in [RFC7749].  The following has
   been registered with IANA.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  rfc+xml

   Required parameters:  There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:  "charset": This parameter has identical
      semantics to the charset parameter of the "application/xml" Media
      Type specified in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

   Encoding considerations:  Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in Section 9.1 of [RFC7303].

   Security considerations:  As defined in Section 6.  In addition, as
      this Media Type uses the "+xml" convention, it inherits the
      security considerations described in Section 10 of [RFC7303].

   Interoperability considerations:  Different implementations of this
      format have had interoperability issues.  It is not expected that
      publication of this application will cause those implementations
      to be fixed.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications that use this Media Type:  Applications that transform
      xml2rfc to output representations such as plain text or HTML, plus
      additional analysis tools.

   Fragment identifier considerations:  The "anchor" attribute is used
      for assigning document-wide unique identifiers that can be used as
      shorthand pointers, as described in [XPOINTER].

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type:  None.

      Magic number(s):  As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC7303].

      File extension(s):  .xml or .rfcxml when disambiguation from other
         XML files is needed

      Macintosh file type code(s):  TEXT

   Person & email address to contact for further information:  See the
      Author's Address section of RFC 7749.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  None

   Author:  See the Author's Address section of RFC 7749.

   Change controller:  RFC Series Editor (rse@rfc-editor.org)

7.2.  Link Relation Registration

   The following is a proposed addition to [LINKRELATIONS].

   Relation Name: convertedFrom

   Description: The document linked to was later converted to the
   document that contains this link relation.  For example, an RFC can
   have a link to the Internet-Draft that became the RFC; in that case,
   the link relation would be "convertedFrom".

   Reference: This document.

   Notes: This relation is different than "predecessor-version" in that
   "predecessor-version" is for items in a version control system.  It
   is also different that "previous" in that this relation is used for
   converted resources, not those that are part of a sequence of
   resources.

   Application Data: none

Appendix A.  Front-Page ("Boilerplate") Generation

   The values listed here will be defined by the RFC Series Editor.
   Those listed here are believed to be the current values in use.

A.1.  The "ipr" Attribute

   This attribute value can take a long list of values, each of which
   describes an IPR policy for the document (Section 2.45.5).  The
   values are not the result of a grand design, but they remain simply
   for historic reasons.  Of these values, only a few are currently in
   use; all others are supported by various tools for backwards
   compatibility with old source files.

      *Note:* some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on
      the document's date; therefore, it is important to specify the
      "year", "month", and "day" attributes of the <date> element when
      archiving the XML source of an Internet-Draft on the day of
      submission.

   _Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER._ For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

   For the current "Copyright Notice" text, the submissionType attribute
   (Section 2.45.12) determines whether a statement about "Code
   Components" is inserted (which is the case for the value "IETF",
   which is the default).  Other values, such as "independent", suppress
   this part of the text.

A.1.1.  Current Values: "*trust200902"

   The name for these values refers tto the IETF Trust's "Legal
   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents", sometimes simply called the
   "TLP", which went into effect on February 15, 2009 ([TLP2.0]).
   Updates to this document were published on September 12, 2009
   [TLP3.0] and on December 28, 2009 [TLP4.0], modifying the license for
   code components (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/> for
   further information).  The actual text is located in Section 6 ("Text
   to Be Included in IETF Documents") of these documents.

   The prep tool automatically produces the "correct" text, depending on
   the document's date information (see above):

   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | TLP      | starting with publication date |
   +----------+--------------------------------+
   | [TLP3.0] | 2009-11-01                     |
   | [TLP4.0] | 2010-04-01                     |
   +----------+--------------------------------+

      The TLP was again updated in March 2015 ([TLP5.0]), but the
      changes made in that version do not affect the boilerplate text.

A.1.1.1.  trust200902

   This value should be used unless one of the more specific
   "*trust200902" values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

A.1.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

      *Note:* this clause is incompatible with RFCs that are published
      on the Standards Track.

A.1.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP:

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

      *Note:* this clause is incompatible with RFCs.

A.1.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause" referring to changes
   introduced in [RFC5378]):

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November
      10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in some of this
      material may not have granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
      modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
      Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s)
      controlling the copyright in such materials, this document may not
      be modified outside the IETF Standards Process, and derivative
      works of it may not be created outside the IETF Standards Process,
      except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate it
      into languages other than English.

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      *Note:* this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status of This Memo".

A.1.2.  Historic Values

A.1.2.1.  Historic Values: "*trust200811"

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811", and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in [TLP1.0].

A.1.2.2.  Historic Values: "*3978"

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978", and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in Section 5 of [RFC3978].

A.1.2.3.  Historic Values: "*3667"

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667", and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in Section 5 of [RFC3667].

A.1.2.4.  Historic Values: "*2026"

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in Section 10 of [RFC2026].

   The special value "none" was also used back then; it denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as an Internet-Draft.

A.2.  The "submissionType" Attribute

   The RFC Editor publishes documents from different "document streams",
   of which the "IETF stream" is the most prominent.  Other streams are
   the Independent Submission stream (used for things such as discussion
   of Internet-related technologies that are not part of the IETF
   agenda), the "IAB stream" (Internet Architecture Board) and the "IRTF
   stream" (Internet Research Task Force).

   The values for the attribute are "IETF" (the default value),
   "independent", "IAB", and "IRTF".

   Historically, this attribute did not affect the final appearance of
   RFCs, except for subtle differences in copyright notices.  Nowadays
   (as of [RFC5741]), the stream name appears in the first line of the
   front page, and it also affects the text in the "Status of This Memo"
   section.

   For current documents, setting the "submissionType" attribute will
   have the following effect:

   o  For RFCs, the stream name appears in the upper left corner of the
      first page (in Internet-Drafts, this is either "Network Working
      Group" or the value of the <workgroup> element).

   o  For RFCs, it affects the whole "Status of This Memo" section (see
      Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5741]).

   o  For all RFCs and Internet-Drafts, it determines whether the
      "Copyright Notice" mentions the Copyright on Code Components (see
      Section 6 of the TLP ("Text to Be Included in IETF Documents")).

A.3.  The "consensus" Attribute

   For some of the publication streams (see Appendix A.2), the "Status
   of This Memo" section depends on whether there was a consensus to
   publish (again, see Section 3.2.2 of [RFC5741]).

   The consensus attribute can be used to supply this information.  The
   acceptable values are "true" (the default) and "false"; "yes" and
   "no" from v2 are deprecated.  For documents in the IRTF stream, this
   value must be "false".

   The effect of this value for the various streams is:

   o  "independent" and "IAB": none.

   o  "IETF": mention that there was an IETF consensus.

   o  "IRTF": the text needs to describe the consensus/review as
      described in Section 2.1 of [RFC5743].

Appendix B.  The v3 Format and Processing Tools

   This section describes topics that are specific to v3 processing
   tools.  Note that there is some discussion of tools in the main body
   of the document as well.  For example, some elements have
   descriptions of how a processing tool might create output from the
   element.

   The expected design of the tools that will be used with v3 documents
   includes:

   o  A "prep tool" that takes a v3 document, makes many checks, adds
      and changes many attribute values, and creates a file that is a
      "prepared document".  The prepared document is a valid v3
      document.  The prep tool is described in [PREPTOOL].

   o  The prep tool is expected to have many modes:

      *  RFC mode -- The mode used by the RFC Editor to process the
         input from one of the RFC streams, and to process XML produced
         during the RFC editing process.  The restrictions on the
         canonical XML for RFCs, as well as how the non-canonical
         formats will look, are described at <https://
         www.rfc-editor.org/rse/wiki/
         doku.php?id=design:format-and-content-rfcs>.

      *  Draft mode -- The mode used by the Internet-Draft submission
         tool.  The restrictions for the XML from this mode will be
         described later.

      *  Diagnostic mode -- A mode that can be used by document authors
         to look for errors or warnings before they submit their
         documents for publication.

      *  Consolidation mode -- Produces output where no external
         resources are required to render the file output.  This
         includes expanding the XInclude entities and DTD entities in
         place, and changing all elements that have "src" attributes
         with external links into either "data:" URI or content for the
         element, as specified in [PREPTOOL].

   o  Formatting tools that will create HTML, PDF, plain text, and
      possibly other output formats.  These formatters will be created
      by the IETF, but others can create such tools as well.  The IETF
      tools are expected to take prepared documents as input.

   There may also be processing tools that are meant to run on the
   computers of authors.  These tools may be used to produce interim
   versions of the non-canonical representations so that authors can see
   how their XML might later be rendered; to create documents in
   representations different than those supported by the RFC Editor; to
   possibly create documents that are not meant to be Internet-Drafts or
   RFCs; and to convert XML that has external information into XML that
   has that external information included.

   The prep tool is expected to have clear error reporting, giving more
   context than just a line number.  For example, the error messages
   should differentiate between errors in XML and those from the v3
   format.

   In v2, the grammar was specified as a DTD.  In v3, the grammar is
   specified only as Relax Next Generation (RNG).  This means that tools
   need to work from the RNG, not from a DTD.  Some of the features of
   the v3 grammar cannot be specified as a DTD.

B.1.  Including External Text with XInclude

   All tools for the v3 format are expected to support XInclude
   [XInclude].  XInclude specifies a processing model and syntax for
   general purpose inclusion of information that is either on the
   Internet or local to the user's computer.

   In the v3 syntax, XInclude is expressed as the <xi:include> element.
   To use this element, you need to include the "xi" namespace in the
   <rfc> element; that is, you need to specify

   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

   as one of the attributes in the <rfc> element.

   The most common way to use <xi:include> is to pull in references that
   are already formed as XML.  Currently, this can be done from
   xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org, but later is expected to be from the RFC
   Editor.  For example, if a document has three normative references,
   all RFCs, the document might contain:

   <references>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.2119.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.4869.xml"/>
       <xi:include href="http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/
          bibxml/reference.RFC.7169.xml"/>
   </references>

   <xi:include> can be used anywhere an XML element could be used (but
   not where free text is used).  For example, if three Internet-Drafts
   are all including a particular paragraph or section verbatim, that
   text can be kept either in a file or somewhere on the web, and be
   included with <xi:include>.  An example of pulling something from the
   local disk would be:

   <x:include href="file://home/chris/ietf/drafts/commontext.xml"/>

   In general, XInclude should be used instead of ENTITY references and
   XML Processing Instructions (PIs) that allow external inclusions.

B.2.  Anchors and IDs

   People writing and reading Internet-Drafts and RFCs often want to
   make reference to specific locations in those documents.  In the case
   of RFC authors, it is common to want to reference another part of
   their document, such as "see Section 3.2 of this document".  Readers,
   on the other hand, want to reference part of documents that they
   didn't write, such as "see Section 3.2 of RFC 6949".  The XML
   vocabulary in this document attempts to support both sets of people.

   Authors can leave anchors in a document that can later be used for
   references with the "anchor" attribute.  Anchors can be included in
   the following elements: <artwork>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <cref>,
   <figure>, <li>, <reference>, <referencegroup>, <section>,
   <sourcecode>, <t>, and <table>.  The author can then refer to that
   anchor in the "target" attribute of the <xref> element.

   Readers can refer to any element that has an "anchor" attribute by
   that attribute.  Note, however, that most of the time, elements won't
   have anchors.  In the common case, the reader wants to refer to an
   element that does not have an "anchor" attribute, but that element
   has "pn" attribute.

   Processing tools add the "pn" attribute to many elements during
   processing.  This attribute and its value are automatically generated
   by the tool if the attribute is not there; if the attribute is
   already there, the tool may replace the value.

B.2.1.  Overlapping Values

   In the HTML representation of this XML vocabulary, both anchors and
   "pn" attributes will be used in the "id" attributes of elements.
   Thus, there can be no overlap between the names entered in "anchor"
   attributes, in "slugifiedName" attributes, and those that are
   generated for the "pn" attributes.  Also, there are some values for
   the "anchor" values that are reserved for sections, and those
   sections can only have those anchor values.

   The following rules prevent this overlap:

   o  "pn" for regular sections always has the format "s-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the section or appendix number.  For example, this would
      be "s-2.1.3" for Section 2.1.3 and "s-a" for Appendix A.  For the
      <abstract> element, it is always "s-abstract".  For the <note>
      element, it is always "s-note-nnn", where "nnn" is a sequential
      value.  For the <boilerplate> element, it is always
      "s-boilerplate-nnn", where "nnn" is a sequential value.

   o  "pn" for <figure> elements always has the format "f-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the figure number.  For example, this would be "f-5" for
      Figure 5.

   o  "pn" for <table> elements always has the format "t-nnn", where
      "nnn" is the table number.  For example, this would be "t-5" for
      Table 5.

   o  "pn" for all elements not listed above always has the format
      "p-nnn-mmm", where "nnn" is the section number and "mmm" is the
      relative position in the section.  For example, this would be
      "p-2.1.3-7" for the seventh part number in Section 2.1.3.

   o  "slugifiedName" always has the format "n-ttt", where "ttt" is the
      text of the name after slugification.  For example, this would be
      "n-protocol-overview" for the name "Protocol Overview".  The
      actual conversions done in slugification will be specified at a
      later time.

   o  Anchors must never overlap with any of the above.  The easiest way
      to assure that is to not pick an anchor name that starts with a
      single letter followed by a hyphen.  If an anchor does overlap
      with one of the types of names above, the processing tool will
      reject the document.

B.3.  Attributes Controlled by the Prep Tool

   Many elements in the v3 vocabulary have new attributes whose role is
   to hold values generated by the prep tool.  These attributes can
   exist in documents that are input to the prep tool; however, any of
   these attributes might be added, removed, or changed by the prep
   tool.  Thus, it is explicitly unsafe for a document author to include
   these attributes and expect that their values will survive processing
   by the prep tool.

   The attributes that are controlled by the prep tool are:

   o  The "pn" attribute in any element -- The number for this item
      within the section.  The numbering is shared with other elements
      of a section.  The "pn" attribute is added to many block-level
      elements inside sections.

   o  <artwork> originalSrc -- This attribute is filled with the
      original value of the "src" attribute if that attribute is removed
      by the prep tool.

   o  <iref> "irefid" attribute -- This attribute is filled with an
      identifier used when creating indexes.

   o  <name> "slugifiedName" attribute -- This attribute is filled with
      a "slugified" version of the text in the element.  This attribute
      can be used in the output formats for elements that have both
      names and numbers.

   o  <relref> "derivedLink" attribute -- This attribute is filled with
      the link that is derived from combining the URI from the reference
      and the relative part that is either a copy of the "relative"
      attribute or a section number derived from the "section"
      attribute.

   o  <relref> "derivedRemoteContent" attribute -- If the <relref>
      element has text content, this attribute is filled with that
      content; the "displayFormat" attribute is set to "bare" if that
      attribute is not already set.  If the <relref> element has no text
      content, this attribute is filled with the text for the remote
      link, such as "Section 2.3" or "Table 5".  The prep tool might
      determine this text by reading the target reference and, if it is
      an RFC or Internet-Draft in the v3 format, finding the anchor
      given in the "relative" attribute or derived from the "section"
      attribute, and using the title of that element.  If the reference
      is not an RFC or Internet-Draft in the v3 format, the text
      fragment is simply the value of the "relative" or "section"
      attribute.  This will rarely produce a good result in formatted
      output so, for these documents, the <relref> element should
      contain text content.

   o  <rfc> "expiresDate" attribute -- This attribute is filled with the
      date that an Internet Draft expires.  The date is in the format
      yyyy-mm-dd.

   o  <rfc> "mode" attribute -- This attribute is filled with a string
      that indicates what mode the prep tool was in when it processed
      the XML, such as whether it was processing a file to become an
      Internet-Draft or an RFC.

   o  <rfc> "scripts" attribute -- This attribute is filled with a list
      of scripts needed to render this document.  The list is comma-
      separated, with no spaces allowed.  The order is unimportant.  The
      names come from [UAX24].  For example, if the document has Chinese
      characters in it, the value might be "Common,Latin,Han".

   o  <sourcecode> "originalSrc" attribute -- This attribute is filled
      with the original value of the "src" attribute if that attribute
      is removed by the prep tool.

   o  <xref> "derivedContent" attribute -- This attribute is filled in
      if there is no content in the <xref> element.  The value for this
      attribute based on the value in the "displayFormat" attribute.
      Examples of how this value is filled can be found at
      Section 2.66.1.

   In addition, note that the contents of the <boilerplate> element is
   controlled by the prep tool.
