<!-- Notes for Paul and Tony

Want to add a section on tables:
	Conversion from <texttable>
	Interesting new things in tables

Want to add links to the rendered outputs in the repo

Want to add a separate section on links, using lots of the attributes.
	But leave them in the main example because they are common.

Want to add examples of <blockquote>
	Example of a cite for a reference that is already in the spec.
	Tony should do this, because Paul thinks <blockquote> is dumb

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary. The examples cover both version 2
<xref target="XML2RFCv2"/> and version 3 <xref target="XML2RFCv3"/>. Some of the examples are given to help
authors use parts of the vocabulary common to both versions (called "v2" and "v3" in this document), while
others appear in order to help authors transitioning from version 2 to version 3 to see how features from
the earlier version relate to features in the later version.
</t>

<t>
This document currently only has one main example, which shows the commonly-used XML elements.
A future version of the document may have a complete example.
