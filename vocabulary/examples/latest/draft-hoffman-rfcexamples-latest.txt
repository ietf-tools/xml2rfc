1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary.  The
   examples cover both version 2 [XML2RFCv2] and version 3 [XML2RFCv3].
   Some of the examples are given to help authors use parts of the
   vocabulary common to both versions (called "v2" and "v3" in this
   document), while others appear in order to help authors transitioning
   from version 2 to version 3 to see how features from the earlier
   version relate to features in the later version.

   This document currently only has one main example, which shows the
   commonly-used XML elements.  A future version of the document may
   have a complete example.

2.  Example of a v2 Document

   The following is a v2 document that has all the elements that are
   needed for typical Internet Drafts.

   <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

   <t>This is this is the first paragraph of the introduction to this
   document. This introduction is probably much shorter than it would
   be for a real Internet Draft.</t>

   <t>Something to note about this paragraph is that it has a
   pointer to <xref target="protocol"/>, and one to
   <xref target="haiku"/>, both of which appear later in the
   document.</t>

   <!-- This is a comment. Comments in the XML do not appear in the
   output formats. -->

   <section title="Terminology">

   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

   <section anchor="protocol" title="The Protocol Being Described">

   <t>This is a reference to <xref target="RFC6949"/>.
   Actually, the reference itself is not all that interesting, but the
   way that the reference is incorporated is. Note that the inclusion
   of RFC 2119 was done at the top of the XML, while the information
   for RFC 6949 is done directly in the references section.</t>

   <section title="Basic Lists">

   <t>Bulleted lists are good for items that
   are not ordered:
