<!-- Notes for Paul and Tony

Have a section that is just examples of what is new in v3 (such as new table features)
	Want to add examples of <blockquote>
		Example of a cite for a reference that is already in the spec.

Add lots of link examples to v2 example for conversion.

Things that will not be in a v3 document such as spanx preamble postamble lists, etc.

In the v3-only examples, use "ascii" attributes liberally

<section title="Introduction">

<t>
This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary. The examples cover both version 2
<xref target="XML2RFCv2"/> and version 3 <xref target="XML2RFCv3"/>. Some of the examples are given to help
authors use parts of the vocabulary common to both versions (called "v2" and "v3" in this document), while
others appear in order to help authors transitioning from version 2 to version 3 to see how features from
the earlier version relate to features in the later version.
</t>

<t>
This document currently only has one main example, which shows the commonly-used XML elements.
A future version of the document may have a more complete example, and will very likely have
topic-specific examples (such as lists, tables, and so on).
