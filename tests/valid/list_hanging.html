<dt>RFC 4662, A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists (S):</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">
<a href="#RFC4662" class="xref">RFC 4662</a> defines an extension to RFC 6665 that allows a client to subscribe to a list of resources using a single subscription. The server, called a Resource List Server (RLS) will "expand" the subscription and subscribe to each individual member of the list. Its primary usage with presence is to allow subscriptions to "buddy lists". Without RFC 4662, a UA would need to subscribe to each presentity individually. With RFC 4662, they can have a single subscription to all buddies. A user can manage the entries in their buddy list using the provisioning mechanisms in <a href="#sec-prov" class="xref">[sec-prov]</a>, below.  </dd>
