xml2rfc (2.3.11) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all outstanding major bugs, details below.
  The issue tracker is at http://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/.

  * Updated the nroff writer to do backslash escaping on source text, to 
    avoid escaping nroff control characters.  Fixes issue #77.

  * Added a modified xref writer to the nroff output writer, in order to 
    handle xref targets which should not be broken across lines.  This, 
    together with changeset [688], fixes issue #80.

  * Added text to the section test case to trigger the second part of issue 
    #79.  It turns out that the changes in [688] fixed this, too; this closes 
    issue #79.

  * Tweaked the nroff generation to not break on hyphens, in order to avoid 
    hyphenated words ending up with embedded spaces: 'pre-processing' becoming 
    'pre- processing' if 'pre-' occurred at the end of an nroff text line.  
    Also tweaked the line-width used in line-breaking to have matching 
    line-breaks between .txt and .nroff output (with exception for lines ending 
    in hyphens).

  * Tweaked roman number list counter to output roman numbers in a field 5 
    spaces wide, instead of having varied widths.  This is different from 
    version 1, so may have to be reverted, depending on how people react.

  * Added a warning for too long lines in figures and tables.  No 
    outdenting for now; I'd like to consult some about that. Fixes issue #76.

  * Updated tests showing that all list format specifiers mentioned in 
    issue #70 now works.  Closes isssue #70.

  * Changed spanx emphasis back to _this_ instead of -this-, matching the v1 
    behaviour.  Addresses issue #70.

  * Make <vspace/> in a hangindent list reset the indentation to the 
    hang-indent, even if the bullet text is longer than the hang-indent.  
    Addresses issue #70.

  * Refined the page-breaking to not insert an extra page break for artwork
    that won't fit on a page anyway.

  * Refined the page-breaking to avoid breaking artwork and tables across 
    pages, if possible.

  * Fixed a problem with centering of titles and labels.  Fixes issue #73.

  * Changed the leading and trailing whitespace lines of a page to better 
    match legacy output.  Fixed the autobreaking algorithm to correctly avoid 
    orphans and widows; fixes issue #72.  Removed an extra blank line at the 
    top of the page following an early page break to avoid orphan or widow.

  * Tweaked the generation of ToC dot-lines and page numbers to better 
    match legacy xml2rfc.  Fixed a bug in the generation of xref text where 
    trailing whitespace could cause double spaces.  Tweaked the output format 
    to produce the correct number of leading blank lines on the first page of a 
    document.

  * Modified the handling of figure titles, so that given titles will be 
    written also without anchor or figure counting.  Fixes issue #75.

  * Tweaked the html writer to have a buffer interface that provides a 
    self.buf similar to the other writers, for test purposes.

  * Reworked the WriterElementTest suite to test all the output formats, 
    not only paginated text.

  * Added a note about /usr/local/bin permissions.  This closes issue #65.

  * Added files describing possible install methods (INSTALL), and possible 
    build commands (Makefile).

  * The syntax that was used to specify the version of the lxml dependency 
    ('>=') is not supported in python distutil setup.py files, and caused setup 
    to try to find an lxml version greater than =2.2.8, which couldn't succeed. 
    Fixed to say '>2.2.7' instead.  This was probably the cause of always 
    reinstalling lxml even when it was present.

  * Updated README.rst to cover the new --date option, and tweaked it a bit.

  * Added some files to provide an enhanced source distribution package.

  * Updated setup.py with maintainer and licence information.

xml2rfc (2.3.10) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
    series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
    draft revision number.

  * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
    correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).

  * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
    the original, not as the changed text of a diff.

  * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
    183 days from document date.

  * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
    necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
    consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
    own code.

  * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
    xml2rfc code.

  * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
    the option parser the appropriate option variable names.

  * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
    help text formatter to the option parser.  

  * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
    line.

  * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  

  * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
    information, instead of an exception traceback.
